Return only the number, named avg_diff.\"\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The question asks for the **average number of games scored** by a home team vs. an away team. However, \"games scored\" is ambiguous \u2014 in basketball context, we usually refer to points scored, not games.\n\nBut the phrasing \"number of games scored\" doesn't make sense \u2014 teams don\u2019t \"score games\", they score points. So likely, this is a misphrasing, and the intended meaning is: **average points scored by home teams vs. away teams**.\n\n2. We need:\n   - Average home team points: from `game_summary.home_team_points`\n   - Average away team points: from `game_summary.away_team_points`\n\n3. Then compute the difference: avg(home_team_points) - avg(away_team_points)\n\n4. Round the result to 1 decimal place (0.1 precision).\n\n5. Return only the number, named `avg_diff`.\n\n6.

The result should include:\n- `is_regular_season`: indicating if the game was in the regular season (BOOLEAN)\n- `avg_points`: the average of total points scored in games, rounded to 1 decimal place\n\nSteps:\n1. The `game_summary` table contains the `is_regular_season` column and the game date.\n2. The `game_boxscore` table contains the `points` scored by each player per game, but we need the total points per game (sum of home_team_points and away_team_points).\n3. To get the total points per game, I can use `game_summary.home_team_points + game_summary.away_team_points`.\n4. I need to join `game_summary` with `game_boxscore` via `game_id` to associate each game with its points.\n5. However, since we want the average of total points per game (not per player), it's better to aggregate at the game level first: sum home and away points for each game.\n6. Then group by `is_regular_season` to compute the average of total points per game.\n7. Round the result to 1 decimal place using `ROUND(avg_total_points, 1)`.\n8.

The user wants to find the player_id who played the highest number of games where they scored at least 20 points in each game. The answer should only include the player_id.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which tables are relevant. The main data about games and player performance is probably in the game_boxscore table. That table has columns like player_id, game_id, and points. So each row in game_boxscore represents a player's stats for a specific game.\n\nThe goal is to count how many games each player has where they scored at least 20 points. So I need to filter the game_boxscore entries where points >= 20. Then, group by player_id and count the number of such games. The player with the highest count is the answer.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a player_season table that aggregates season stats. However, the user is asking about individual games, not seasons. So the game_boxscore is the right place.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Select player_id from game_boxscore where points >= 20.\n2. Group by player_id.\n3. Count the number of games (maybe using COUNT(game_id) or just COUNT(*)) for each player.\n4. Order the results by the count in descending order.\n5. Limit to the top 1.\n\nBut wait, do I need to join with other tables? The user only wants player_id, which is present in game_boxscore. So maybe no joins are needed. Let me check the schema again.\n\nLooking at the game_boxscore table, it has player_id. So the query can be written directly on game_boxscore. No need to join with player table unless we need the name, but the user only wants player_id. So the query is straightforward.\n\nSo the SQL would be:\n\nSELECT player_id, COUNT(*) as game_count\nFROM game_boxscore\nWHERE points >= 20\nGROUP BY player_id\nORDER BY game_count DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n\nBut wait, the user wants only the player_id. So maybe the COUNT is just part of the grouping. Wait, the user's example shows that the answer should be the player_id. So the query should return the player_id of the player with the highest count. So the SQL would select player_id, but order by the count. However, in SQL, you can't order by an alias in the same query. So perhaps the query is:\n\nSELECT player_id\nFROM game_boxscore\nWHERE points >= 20\nGROUP BY player_id\nORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the player_id is grouped, and the count of games (where points >=20) is used to order. The top one is selected.\n\nAre there any other considerations? For example, if a player has multiple entries for the same game (unlikely), but the game_boxscore probably has one entry per player per game. So COUNT(*) would correctly count the number of games.\n\nSo the final SQL query is:\n\nSELECT player_id\nFROM game_boxscore\nWHERE points >= 20\nGROUP BY player_id\nORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n\nThat should give the player_id with the most games scoring at least 20 points.\n\u25c1/think\u25b7\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT player_id\nFROM game_boxscore\nWHERE points >= 20\nGROUP BY player_id\nORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC\nLIMIT 1\n```\n</sql_query>",

So, I need to find the maximum points scored by any player in any game and return that player's ID along with the points.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the tables provided. The game_boxscore table has a 'points' column, which likely represents the points scored by a player in a specific game. Each row in game_boxscore probably corresponds to a player's performance in a particular game. The player_id is a foreign key linking to the player table.\n\nSo, the main idea is to select the player_id and points from game_boxscore where the points are the highest. But wait, maybe there are multiple entries with the same high score. The user wants the highest number, so I should order by points in descending order and take the top one.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the user's example query uses an inner join between player, game_boxscore, and game_summary. But in this case, the question doesn't require joining with game_summary or player name. The user just wants player_id and points. So maybe the query can be simpler.\n\nWait, the user's example includes the player name, but the current question only asks for player_id. So perhaps the query can just select from game_boxscore. Let me check the columns again. The game_boxscore has player_id and points. So the query would be:\n\nSELECT player_id, points\nFROM game_boxscore\nORDER BY points DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n\nBut wait, maybe there are multiple games where the same player scored the same high points. The LIMIT 1 would pick one of them. But the user wants the highest number, so this should work. However, the example in the user's instructions includes more complex joins. But in this case, maybe it's not necessary. Let me confirm.\n\nThe problem is to find the single highest points in any game. So the maximum value in the points column of game_boxscore. So the query would be straightforward. But perhaps the user's database has some constraints. For example, maybe the points column is named differently. Wait, looking at the game_boxscore table schema, there is a 'points' column. Yes.\n\nSo the SQL query would be:\n\nSELECT player_id, points\nFROM game_boxscore\nORDER BY points DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n\nBut wait, maybe the user's example uses more tables, but in this case, it's not needed. The example was about minutes played over a year, which required joining game_summary for dates. But here, the question is about a single game's points. So no need to join other tables. So the answer should be a simple query on game_boxscore.\n\nBut let me check again. The user's question is: \"Which player_id scored the highest number of points in a game?\" So the answer is the player_id and points for the single game with the highest points. So the query is correct.\n\nBut maybe there's a tie. The LIMIT 1 would return one of them. But the user probably wants the top score, regardless of ties. So this should be acceptable.\n\nSo the final SQL query is:\n\nSELECT player_id, points\nFROM game_boxscore\nORDER BY points DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n\u25c1/think\u25b7\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT player_id, points\nFROM game_boxscore\nORDER BY points DESC\nLIMIT 1\n```\n</sql_query>",

                "llm_response": "\u25c1think\u25b7Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know the highest number of points scored by a team in a single game, whether they were playing at home or away. The answer should just be the number, called max_score.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where the points data is stored. Looking at the tables provided, the game_summary table has home_team_points and away_team_points. Those are the likely candidates because each row in game_summary probably represents a single game, with points for both teams.\n\nSo, the maximum points scored in a game would be the highest value between all home_team_points and away_team_points across all games. But how do I combine those two columns into one to find the maximum?\n\nWait, maybe I can select both columns, then use a UNION to combine them into a single column, and then take the maximum of that. Alternatively, for each game, the maximum points would be the higher of home or away, but the user wants the highest score by any team in any game. So regardless of whether it's home or away, we need to consider all team scores.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to select all home_team_points and away_team_points into a single list and then find the maximum of that combined list.\n\nSo, the SQL query would involve selecting home_team_points and away_team_points from game_summary, then using a UNION to stack them into a single column, and then applying MAX() on that.\n\nWait, but UNION removes duplicates. Maybe using UNION ALL would be better to include all entries. Then, take the maximum of that combined set.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. From game_summary, select home_team_points as score.\n2. From the same table, select away_team_points as score.\n3. Combine these two result sets into one column using UNION ALL.\n4. Then, find the maximum value in that column.\n\nBut how to structure that in SQL. Maybe a subquery that unions the two columns, then select max from that.\n\nAlternatively, use a CASE statement or something else. Wait, another approach: for each game, take the maximum of home and away points, then find the maximum of those. But that would give the highest score in a game, but if one team scored more than another in a different game, that might not capture it.\n\nWait, no. For example, if Game A has Home: 100, Away: 90, and Game B has Home: 95, Away: 110. The maximum team score is 110 (Away in Game B). So taking the maximum of all home and away scores would be the correct approach.\n\nSo the correct approach is to collect all home and away scores into a single list and find the maximum.\n\nSo the SQL would be:\n\nSELECT MAX(score) as max_score\nFROM (\n    SELECT home_team_points as score FROM game_summary\n    UNION ALL\n    SELECT away_team_points as score FROM game_summary\n) as all_scores;\n\nBut wait, the user wants the highest number of points scored by a team in a single game. So each game has two teams, each with their own score. The maximum of all those individual scores is the answer.\n\nSo combining both home and away scores into a single column and then taking the max.\n\nSo the subquery approach would work. Let me check the tables again. The game_summary has home_team_points and away_team_points. So the query would be:\n\nSELECT MAX(points) as max_score\nFROM (\n    SELECT home_team_points as points FROM game_summary\n    UNION ALL\n    SELECT away_team_points as points FROM game_summary\n) as all_points;\n\nYes, that makes sense. The UNION ALL combines all home and away scores into a single column, and then MAX() finds the highest value.\n\nNow, checking the data types. The home_team_points and away_team_points are of type HUGEINT. So using them directly should be okay.\n\nSo the final SQL query would be:\n\nSELECT MAX(points) as max_score\nFROM (\n    SELECT home_team_points as points FROM game_summary\n    UNION ALL\n    SELECT away_team_points as points FROM game_summary\n) as all_points;\n\nBut wait, the user's example shows that the output should be just the number, named max_score. So the query should select that alias.\n\nYes, the query above would return a single row with the max_score.\n\nSo that's the correct approach. Now, let's write the SQL code accordingly.\n\u25c1/think\u25b7\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT MAX(points) as max_score\nFROM (\n    SELECT home_team_points as points FROM game_summary\n    UNION ALL\n    SELECT away_team_points as points FROM game_summary\n) as all_points\n```\n</sql_query>",

The answer should return just that number, named max_blocks.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which tables to use. The game_boxscore table has a 'blocks' column, which records the number of blocks a player made in a specific game. So that's the primary table to look at. Each row in game_boxscore corresponds to a player's performance in a particular game. The 'blocks' field here is an integer.\n\nThe task is to find the maximum value in the 'blocks' column across all entries in game_boxscore. Since we're looking for the highest single-game total, we don't need to aggregate over multiple games. We just need to find the maximum value in that column.\n\nSo the SQL query should select the maximum value from the 'blocks' column in the game_boxscore table. The user wants the result to be named 'max_blocks', so I'll use an alias for that column.\n\nLooking at the example provided, the user's response includes a thinking section where they outline the steps. In this case, the steps are straightforward: select the max(blocks) from game_boxscore and alias it as max_blocks.\n\nI don't need to join any other tables because the information is directly in game_boxscore. There's no need to consider player names or game dates; just the blocks count. So the query is simple: SELECT MAX(blocks) AS max_blocks FROM game_boxscore.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a possibility that some entries in game_boxscore are invalid, like negative blocks or something. But according to the table schema, the 'blocks' column is an INTEGER. Assuming that the data is clean and there are no negative values, the MAX function will correctly find the highest number.\n\nSo the final SQL query would be:\n\nSELECT MAX(blocks) AS max_blocks FROM game_boxscore;\n\nThat's it. No joins, no group by, just a straightforward max query.\n\u25c1/think\u25b7\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT MAX(blocks) AS max_blocks\nFROM game_boxscore\n```\n</sql_query>",

The result should be in percentage format between 0 and 100, and the column should be named max_pct_game_win.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where the winning percentages are stored. Looking at the provided tables, there's a team_season table which has a column called pct_game_win. That seems like the right place. The team_season table likely contains each team's performance for each season, including their winning percentage.\n\nSo the main task is to query the team_season table for the maximum value of pct_game_win. But wait, the user wants it scaled between 0 and 100. The existing pct_game_win might be a decimal (like 0.75 for 75%), so multiplying by 100 would convert it to a percentage. But the example given in the problem shows percentages like 11.22%, which suggests that the stored value is already in percentage form. Wait, no. The example says \"precision to 0.01%\", so maybe the stored value is a decimal (0.75) and needs to be multiplied by 100 to get 75.00%. But the user's example shows 11.22%, which would be 0.1122 in decimal. So perhaps the pct_game_win in the team_season table is stored as a decimal (e.g., 0.75 for 75%), and we need to multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nWait, looking at the team_season table's columns: pct_game_win is a DOUBLE. So if the team's winning percentage is 75%, then pct_game_win would be 0.75. To display it as 75.00%, we need to multiply by 100 and format it to two decimal places.\n\nSo the SQL query would select the maximum pct_game_win from team_season, multiply by 100, round to two decimal places, and alias it as max_pct_game_win.\n\nBut wait, maybe the pct_game_win is already stored as a percentage (like 75.0), so we don't need to multiply. Let me check the table definitions again. The team_season table has nb_game_win and nb_game, so pct_game_win is probably calculated as nb_game_win / nb_game. If that's stored as a decimal (0.75), then multiplying by 100 would give 75.0. But if it's stored as 75.0, then we don't need to do anything. The problem statement says the user wants the result in percentage scaled between 0 and 100. So if the stored value is 0.75, then multiplying by 100 gives 75.0, which is correct. If it's stored as 75.0, then we leave it as is. But looking at the column name pct_game_win, which is a common way to denote percentage as a decimal (like 0.75). So I think the correct approach is to multiply by 100.\n\nWait, the example given in the problem says \"e.g. 11.22%\", which is 0.1122 in decimal. So if the stored value is 0.1122, then multiplying by 100 gives 11.22. But if the stored value is 11.22, then we don't need to multiply. But the column is called pct_game_win, which is typically a decimal. For example, in many databases, a percentage is stored as a decimal (0.75) and then displayed as 75%. So I think the correct approach is to multiply by 100.\n\nSo the query would be:\n\nSELECT MAX(pct_game_win) * 100 AS max_pct_game_win\nFROM team_season;\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a need to round to two decimal places. The user wants the precision to 0.01%, which is two decimal places. So using ROUND(MAX(pct_game_win) * 100, 2) would give the correct formatting.\n\nBut in SQL, the ROUND function might vary. For PostgreSQL, ROUND(number, 2) would round to two decimal places. So the query would be:\n\nSELECT ROUND(MAX(pct_game_win) * 100, 2) AS max_pct_game_win\nFROM team_season;\n\nBut wait, maybe the pct_game_win is already stored as a percentage (like 75.0), so multiplying by 100 would be incorrect. Let me think again. The user's example shows 11.22%, which is 0.1122 in decimal. If the team_season's pct_game_win is 0.1122, then multiplying by 100 gives 11.22. If it's stored as 11.22, then we don't need to multiply. But the column name is pct_game_win, which is a common way to denote a percentage as a decimal. For example, 75% is stored as 0.75. So I think the correct approach is to multiply by 100.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the team_season's pct_game_win is already in percentage form (like 75.0), so we don't need to multiply. But looking at the columns in team_season: nb_game_win and nb_game. So if pct_game_win is calculated as nb_game_win / nb_game, then that would be a decimal (e.g., 0.75). So multiplying by 100 would convert it to 75.0.\n\nSo the correct query is to take the maximum of pct_game_win, multiply by 100, round to two decimal places, and alias as max_pct_game_win.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a need to check if the team_season table has any rows where nb_game is zero, which would cause division by zero. But the problem is about the highest winning percentage, so perhaps we can assume that there are games played.\n\nSo the SQL query would be:\n\nSELECT ROUND(MAX(pct_game_win) * 100, 2) AS max_pct_game_win\nFROM team_season;\n\nBut wait, the user wants the result in percentage, scaled between 0 and 100. So if the stored value is 0.75, then multiplying by 100 gives 75.0. If the stored value is 75.0, then multiplying by 100 would give 7500.0, which is incorrect. So which is it?\n\nLooking at the team_season table's columns: pct_game_win is a DOUBLE. The name suggests it's a percentage, but in database terms, percentage can be stored as a decimal (0.75) or as a percentage (75.0). But given that the columns are named pct_game_win, it's more likely that it's stored as a decimal. For example, in many sports databases, a winning percentage of 75% is stored as 0.75. So multiplying by 100 would convert it to 75.0, which is the correct percentage.\n\nSo the query would be:\n\nSELECT ROUND(MAX(pct_game_win) * 100, 2) AS max_pct_game_win\nFROM team_season;\n\nBut wait, maybe the team_season table's pct_game_win is already in percentage form. Let me check the other columns. The team_season has nb_game_win and nb_game. So if pct_game_win is calculated as (nb_game_win / nb_game) * 100, then it would be stored as a percentage. But if it's calculated as nb_game_win / nb_game, then it's a decimal. The column name pct_game_win is ambiguous. For example, in some databases, \"percentage\" is stored as a decimal, and \"pct\" is used to denote that. So 0.75 is 75%.\n\nBut the user's example shows that the answer should be in percentage format, like 11.22%. So if the stored value is 0.1122, then multiplying by 100 gives 11.22. If the stored value is 11.22, then we don't need to multiply. But given that the column is called pct_game_win, which is a common way to denote a decimal, I think the correct approach is to multiply by 100.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the team_season's pct_game_win is already in percentage form. Let me think: if a team has 75% win rate, then pct_game_win would be 75.0. So the maximum would be, say, 100.0. But that's possible if a team wins all games. But in reality, the highest winning percentage in an NBA season is 87.8% (73-9 record). So if the stored value is 87.8, then multiplying by 100 would give 8780.0, which is incorrect. Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps the stored value is 0.878, and multiplying by 100 gives 87.80, which is correct.\n\nSo the correct approach is to multiply by 100. Therefore, the query is:\n\nSELECT ROUND(MAX(pct_game_win) * 100, 2) AS max_pct_game_win\nFROM team_season;\n\nBut wait, maybe the team_season's pct_game_win is already in percentage form. Let me check the other tables. The player_season table has columns like avg_points, etc. But that's not directly related. The game_summary has winning_team_id, but that's per game. The team_bis and team tables have team names. The season table has start and end dates. The team_season table is the most relevant here.\n\nSo the query is straightforward: find the maximum pct_game_win in team_season, multiply by 100, round to two decimal places, and alias as max_pct_game_win.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a need to check if the team_season table has any entries. But the problem assumes that the database has data.\n\nSo the final SQL query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT ROUND(MAX(pct_game_win) * 100, 2) AS max_pct_game_win\nFROM team_season;\n```\n\nBut wait, the user's example shows that the SQL query is written with proper syntax. Let me check the syntax. In PostgreSQL, the ROUND function can take two arguments: the number and the number of decimal places. So ROUND(123.456, 2) would return 123.46. So the query is correct.\n\nBut what if the pct_game_win is stored as a percentage (like 75.0)? Then multiplying by 100 would give 7500.0, which is incorrect. But that's unlikely. The name \"pct_game_win\" suggests it's a decimal. For example, in many sports databases, a team's winning percentage is stored as a decimal between 0 and 1. So 0.75 is 75%.\n\nTherefore, the correct query is to multiply by 100. So the answer is:\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT ROUND(MAX(pct_game_win) * 100, 2) AS max_pct_game_win\nFROM team_season;\n```\n</sql_query>\n\u25c1/think\u25b7\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT ROUND(MAX(pct_game_win) * 100, 2) AS max_pct_game_win\nFROM team_season;\n```\n</sql_query>",

The user wants to find the difference between the average number of games scored by a home team and an away team, rounded to one decimal place. The result should be a single number named avg_diff.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where the relevant data is. The game_summary table has home_team_points and away_team_points for each game. So, the average home score would be the sum of all home_team_points divided by the number of games, and similarly for away.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"games scored by a home team and an away team\". Wait, maybe they mean the average points per game for home teams versus away teams. So, for each game, the home team's points are in home_team_points, and the away team's in away_team_points. So the average home score is the average of home_team_points across all games, and the average away score is the average of away_team_points. Then the difference is home average minus away average.\n\nSo the SQL query would need to calculate the average of home_team_points and the average of away_team_points, then subtract the latter from the former. Then round that to one decimal place.\n\nLooking at the tables, the game_summary has the necessary columns: home_team_points and away_team_points. So the query can directly select from game_summary.\n\nWait, but maybe there are some conditions? Like regular season games only? The user's question doesn't specify, so perhaps all games are considered. Unless the problem requires filtering, but the user didn't mention that. So the query would just take all rows in game_summary.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the average of home_team_points.\n2. Calculate the average of away_team_points.\n3. Subtract the away average from the home average.\n4. Round the result to one decimal place.\n5. Alias the result as avg_diff.\n\nIn SQL, that would be something like:\n\nSELECT \n    ROUND(AVG(home_team_points) - AVG(away_team_points), 1) AS avg_diff\nFROM game_summary;\n\nBut wait, does the game_summary table have those columns? Yes, according to the schema provided. So that's the query.\n\nBut maybe there's a need to check if there are any NULL values? But the problem states that the data is in the database, so perhaps the columns are not nullable. But in any case, using AVG would ignore NULLs, but if all rows have those values, then it's okay.\n\nSo the SQL query is straightforward. The user's example shows that sometimes joins are needed, but in this case, only the game_summary table is required. So the answer is a simple SELECT statement from game_summary, calculating the averages and their difference.\n\u25c1/think\u25b7\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT \n    ROUND(AVG(home_team_points) - AVG(away_team_points), 1) AS avg_diff\nFROM game_summary;\n```\n</sql_query>",

The user wants to know the average cumulative number of points scored in a game, depending on whether it's a regular season game or not. The result should have two columns: is_regular_season and avg_points, ordered by is_regular_season.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where the points are being tracked. Looking at the tables, the game_boxscore has a 'points' column. But that's probably per player per game. Wait, but the question is about the cumulative points per game. Wait, maybe the game_summary table has the total points for each game. Let me check. The game_summary has home_team_points and away_team_points. So the total points for a game would be the sum of those two. That makes sense because the cumulative points in a game would be the total points scored by both teams combined.\n\nSo the first step is to calculate the total points per game. Then, group those by whether the game is a regular season or not. Then, average those totals for each group.\n\nSo the tables involved would be game_summary. Because each game in game_summary has is_regular_season, and the points for each game are home + away. Then, we can sum those and group by is_regular_season, then average.\n\nWait, but the user wants the average cumulative points. So for each game, the cumulative points are home_team_points + away_team_points. Then, we need to find the average of that sum for regular season games and non-regular season games.\n\nSo the SQL query would be:\n\nSELECT is_regular_season, AVG(home_team_points + away_team_points) AS avg_points\nFROM game_summary\nGROUP BY is_regular_season\nORDER BY is_regular_season;\n\nBut wait, the user wants the average rounded to 0.1. So maybe using ROUND function. But how to round to one decimal place in PostgreSQL. The ROUND function can take a precision. So ROUND(avg_points, 1). But in the SELECT statement, we can apply that.\n\nSo modifying the query:\n\nSELECT is_regular_season, ROUND(AVG(home_team_points + away_team_points), 1) AS avg_points\nFROM game_summary\nGROUP BY is_regular_season\nORDER BY is_regular_season;\n\nThat should give the desired result. Let me check the columns in game_summary. Yes, home_team_points and away_team_points are present. So this query should work. No need to join other tables because all the necessary data is in game_summary.\n\nWait, but maybe the user is asking for the average points per team per game? Or the total points per game. The question says \"cumulated number of points scored in a game\". So the total points in a game is the sum of both teams. So the average of that sum for regular vs non-regular games.\n\nYes, so the query above should be correct. Let me make sure the data types are okay. The home and away team points are HUGEINT, so their sum would be a BIGINT. AVG would then compute the average as a numeric. Then rounding to one decimal place.\n\nSo the final SQL query would be:\n\nSELECT is_regular_season, ROUND(AVG(home_team_points + away_team_points), 1) AS avg_points\nFROM game_summary\nGROUP BY is_regular_season\nORDER BY is_regular_season;\n\nThat's the answer. No need to join other tables. The game_summary has all the necessary information.\n\u25c1/think\u25b7\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT is_regular_season, ROUND(AVG(home_team_points + away_team_points), 1) AS avg_points\nFROM game_summary\nGROUP BY is_regular_season\nORDER BY is_regular_season;\n```\n</sql_query>",

The answer should be a SQL query that returns just that number, named max_pts.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which tables to use. The main goal is to find LeBron James' game with the most points. The game_boxscore table has points per game for each player, so that's a key table. The player table will have LeBron's ID, so I need to join those two.\n\nLooking at the tables provided, game_boxscore has a player_id field. The player table has id and player_name. So I can join game_boxscore with player where player_name is 'LeBron James'. Then, select the maximum points from that joined data.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a case sensitivity issue. The player's name in the database might be stored as 'LeBron James' exactly, but sometimes databases have variations. But the user specified the name as is, so I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Select the points column from game_boxscore where the player_id matches the id of LeBron James in the player table.\n2. Find the maximum value of points from those rows.\n\nThe SQL query would involve joining game_boxscore and player on player_id = id, filtering where player_name is 'LeBron James', and then taking the max of points.\n\nWait, but the user wants the highest points in a single game. So it's the maximum value of the points column for all games where LeBron played. So the query would be:\n\nSELECT MAX(gb.points) AS max_pts\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'LeBron James';\n\nThat seems straightforward. Let me check the table structures again. The game_boxscore has a points column of type INTEGER. The player table has player_name as VARCHAR. The join is on player_id (gb) and id (p). So the query should work.\n\nBut maybe there's a possibility that LeBron's name is stored with different casing or spaces. But the user's example uses 'LeBron James', so assuming the database has it exactly like that.\n\nAnother thing to consider: Are there multiple entries for the same game? Like if a player played in multiple quarters or something. But the game_boxscore's id is a VARCHAR, so each row is probably a unique game entry for a player. So taking the max of points per row should be correct.\n\nSo the final SQL query would be as above. Let me write that in the required format.\n\nThe thinking part would explain the steps: joining the two tables, filtering by player name, and taking the max. The SQL query would use SELECT MAX, JOIN, and WHERE clause.\n\u25c1/think\u25b7\n\n<thinking>\nTo find the highest points scored by LeBron James in a single game, I need to:\n\n1.

So, I need to find the maximum points scored by any player in any game and return the player's name along with that point total.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which tables to use. The game_boxscore table has a 'points' column, which likely represents the points scored by a player in a specific game. The player's name is in the player table. So, I need to join game_boxscore with player to get the player names.\n\nLooking at the tables, game_boxscore has a player_id which matches the id in the player table. So, joining those two tables makes sense. The goal is to find the maximum points in a single game, so I need to look at each row in game_boxscore, which represents a player's stats for a particular game.\n\nThe query should select the player_name from player and the points from game_boxscore. Then, order the results by points in descending order and limit to the top result. But wait, maybe there are multiple entries with the same points? The user probably wants the highest value, so ordering and taking the first one is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Select player_name from player and points from game_boxscore.\n2. Join player and game_boxscore on player.id = game_boxscore.player_id.\n3. Order by points DESC.\n4. Limit to 1.\n\nBut wait, the user's example uses aliases like p for player and gb for game_boxscore. Let me check the table names. The game_boxscore table is called game_boxscore, and player is called player. So in the SQL, I should use those table names.\n\nWait, in the example, the user uses 'from player p' which is an alias. So maybe I should do the same here. Let's structure the query:\n\nSELECT p.player_name, gb.points AS nb_points\nFROM player p\nINNER JOIN game_boxscore gb ON gb.player_id = p.id\nORDER BY nb_points DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n\nWait, but the column in game_boxscore is called 'points', right? Yes, looking at the schema, game_boxscore has a 'points' column of type INTEGER. So that's the correct column to use.\n\nSo the query would be:\n\nSELECT p.player_name, gb.points AS nb_points\nFROM player p\nJOIN game_boxscore gb ON p.id = gb.player_id\nORDER BY nb_points DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n\nBut wait, maybe there are multiple games where the same player scored the same high points? The user wants the highest number, so even if multiple players have the same max, the query would return one. But the user's example uses LIMIT 1, so that's acceptable.\n\nNow, checking the output format. The user's example uses backticks for the SQL code. So the final answer should be wrapped in <sql_query> tags with the code inside.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT p.player_name, gb.points AS nb_points\nFROM player p\nINNER JOIN game_boxscore gb ON p.id = gb.player_id\nORDER BY nb_points DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n</sql_query>\n\nWait, but in the example, the user uses 'sum(gb.minute_played)' and groups by player. But in this case, we're looking for a single game's points, so no aggregation is needed. Each row in game_boxscore is a player's stats for a single game. So the maximum points in any single row would be the answer.\n\nTherefore, the query is correct as is. No need for GROUP BY because each row is a game. So the highest points in any row would be the answer.\n\u25c1/think\u25b7\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT p.player_name, gb.points AS nb_points\nFROM player p\nINNER JOIN game_boxscore gb ON p.id = gb.player_id\nORDER BY nb_points DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n</sql_query>",

The answer should return only the team name as team_name.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which tables are relevant. The game_summary table has home_team_points and away_team_points, as well as home_team_id and away_team_id. That's probably where the game scores are stored. The team table has team names, so I'll need to join the team ID from game_summary to get the name.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum home_team_points in any game. So I should select the home_team_id and home_team_points from game_summary, then join with the team table to get the team name. But wait, maybe there are multiple games where the same team scored the maximum points. The user wants the team that holds the record, so I need to find the highest home_team_points across all games, then get the team name associated with that.\n\nWait, but the question is about the highest points scored by a home team in a single game. So the team that, when playing at home, scored the most points ever. So I need to look at all home_team_points in game_summary, find the maximum value, and then find which team_id corresponds to that game. Then join that team_id with the team table to get the name.\n\nBut how to structure the SQL query. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, select the home_team_id and home_team_points from game_summary. Then, find the maximum home_team_points. But how to get the team that achieved that maximum. Maybe order by home_team_points desc and take the top one. But then, need to join with the team table to get the name.\n\nWait, but maybe there are multiple games where the same team scored the maximum. For example, if Team A scored 150 points in two different home games. But the user wants the team name, not the specific game. So the answer is the team that has the highest home_team_points in any game.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. From game_summary, find the maximum home_team_points.\n2. Find the home_team_id that corresponds to that maximum.\n3. Join that home_team_id with the team table to get the team name.\n\nBut how to structure this in SQL. Maybe a subquery to find the max points, then select the team that has that max.\n\nAlternatively, order the home_team_points in descending order, take the first one, and get the team name.\n\nSo the SQL query would be something like:\n\nSELECT t.team_name AS team_name\nFROM game_summary gs\nJOIN team t ON gs.home_team_id = t.id\nORDER BY gs.home_team_points DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n\nWait, but does that work? Because the game_summary has home_team_points, and we're ordering by that. The first row would be the game with the highest home_team_points. Then, the team name from that row's home_team_id. That should give the correct team.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are multiple games where the same team holds the record. For example, if Team A scored 150 in one game and 140 in another, but another team scored 145. Then the first row would be Team A's 150 game. The team name would be Team A. That's correct.\n\nBut what if two different teams have the same maximum points? For example, Team A and Team B both scored 150 in different games. Then the query would return Team A (or whichever comes first based on the order). But the user wants the team that scored the highest. So if there's a tie, the query would return one of them. But the user's question doesn't specify handling ties, so maybe that's acceptable.\n\nSo the SQL query would be:\n\nSELECT t.team_name AS team_name\nFROM game_summary gs\nJOIN team t ON gs.home_team_id = t.id\nORDER BY gs.home_team_points DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n\nBut wait, the user's example shows that the SQL query uses aliases and proper joins. Let me check the table structures again.\n\nThe game_summary table has home_team_id as a VARCHAR, and the team table has id as VARCHAR. So joining on gs.home_team_id = t.id is correct.\n\nBut maybe the team table is named 'team' or 'team_bis'? Wait, looking at the data provided, there's a 'team' table and a 'team_bis' table. Which one to use? The user's example uses 'team' in the data. Let me check:\n\nIn the Data section, there's a table called 'team' with id and team_name. There's also a 'team_bis' with the same structure. But which one is used in the database? The user's example in the problem statement might have a typo. Wait, the user's example response uses 'team' table. But in the data provided, there's a 'team' and 'team_bis'. Hmm. Maybe the correct table is 'team'? Or perhaps 'team_bis' is a typo and should be 'team'? Or maybe the user intended to have two tables, but that's unclear. Wait, looking at the Data section:\n\nTable: team\n  - id: VARCHAR\n  - team_name: VARCHAR\n\nTable: team_bis\n  - id: VARCHAR\n  - team_name: VARCHAR\n\nSo there are two tables with similar structures. That's confusing. Which one should be used? The problem statement says that the SQL request must respect the schema. So perhaps the correct table is 'team', and 'team_bis' is a different table. But the user's example uses 'team' in the data. Wait, in the example response, the user's SQL query refers to 'player' and 'game_boxscore' and 'game_summary', which are present in the data. So perhaps the correct team table is 'team', not 'team_bis'. So the join should be with 'team' table.\n\nSo the SQL query would be:\n\nSELECT t.team_name AS team_name\nFROM game_summary gs\nJOIN team t ON gs.home_team_id = t.id\nORDER BY gs.home_team_points DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n\nBut wait, the user's example uses 'player' and 'game_boxscore' and 'game_summary', so the team table is likely 'team', not 'team_bis'. So the correct join is with 'team'.\n\nBut what if the team_bis is the correct one? The user's data includes both. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the user's example in the problem statement uses 'team' in the data. So perhaps the correct table is 'team'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'team_bis' is a typo and should be 'team'? But the user provided both tables. So perhaps the correct one is 'team'.\n\nAssuming that the 'team' table is the correct one, the SQL query would be as above.\n\nBut wait, the user's example in the problem statement's example response uses 'player' and 'game_boxscore' and 'game_summary', which are present. So the same approach applies here.\n\nSo the final SQL query would be:\n\nSELECT t.team_name AS team_name\nFROM game_summary gs\nJOIN team t ON gs.home_team_id = t.id\nORDER BY gs.home_team_points DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n\nBut wait, the user's example shows that the SQL query uses backticks for the code. So the correct format would be:\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT t.team_name AS team_name\nFROM game_summary gs\nJOIN team t ON gs.home_team_id = t.id\nORDER BY gs.home_team_points DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n</sql_query>\n\nBut wait, the user's example uses 'p.player_name' and 'gb.minute_played' and 'gs.date', which are columns from the respective tables. So in this case, the columns are 'home_team_id' and 'home_team_points' from game_summary, and 'team_name' from team.\n\nBut what if the team table is actually 'team_bis'? Then the join would be with team_bis. But the user's data includes both. How to determine which one to use? The problem statement says that the SQL request must respect the schema. So perhaps the correct table is 'team', as the user's example uses 'team' in the data. Alternatively, maybe the 'team_bis' is a typo. But given the information, I'll proceed with 'team' as the correct table.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n<thinking>\nTo find the team that scored the highest points as the home team, I need to look into the game_summary table where home_team_points are stored.

The result should include player_name and max_nb_blocks, sorted by player name.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where the blocks data is stored. Looking at the tables provided, the game_boxscore has a 'blocks' column. That's probably where each player's blocks per game are recorded. So I should look into that table.\n\nNext, I need to connect the player's name with their blocks. The game_boxscore has a player_id, which can be joined with the player table's id to get the player_name.\n\nSo the plan is: select player_name and the maximum blocks from game_boxscore. But wait, the user wants the highest number in a single game. So for each player, I need to find their maximum blocks in any game they played. Then, find the maximum of those maxima. Wait, no. Wait, the user wants the player(s) who have the highest single-game block count. So first, find the maximum blocks in any game across all players. Then, find all players who have achieved that maximum.\n\nWait, maybe I should first find the maximum blocks in any game. Then, select all player-game entries where blocks equal that maximum. Then, group by player and take the maximum of those. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the user is asking for the highest number of blocks in a single game. So the answer is the maximum value of the 'blocks' column in game_boxscore. Then, find all players who have at least one game where their blocks equal that maximum. Then, for each such player, return their name and that maximum value.\n\nWait, but the user wants the player(s) who have the highest single-game block count. So the max_nb_blocks is the maximum value of blocks in any game. Then, the players are those who have achieved that maximum in at least one game. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Find the maximum blocks value in the entire game_boxscore table.\n2. Find all rows in game_boxscore where blocks equals that maximum.\n3. For each player in those rows, get their name and the maximum blocks.\n\nBut wait, the user wants the columns player_name and max_nb_blocks. So for each player who has a game with the maximum blocks, their max_nb_blocks would be that value. But since all those players have the same max, the max_nb_blocks would be the same for all. So perhaps the query can be structured as:\n\nFirst, find the maximum blocks in any game:\n\nSELECT MAX(blocks) FROM game_boxscore;\n\nThen, find all players who have a game with that maximum:\n\nSELECT p.player_name, gb.blocks AS max_nb_blocks\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nWHERE gb.blocks = (SELECT MAX(blocks) FROM game_boxscore)\nORDER BY p.player_name;\n\nBut wait, the user's example shows that they want to return all players if there are several. So this approach would work. But in the example given by the user, the query uses a GROUP BY. Wait, maybe in the example, they are summing over multiple games. But in this case, we are looking for a single game's maximum. So the game_boxscore's blocks column is the number of blocks in that specific game. So the maximum of that column is the highest single-game block count. Then, the players who have that value in any of their games are the ones to return.\n\nSo the SQL query would be:\n\nSELECT p.player_name, gb.blocks AS max_nb_blocks\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nWHERE gb.blocks = (SELECT MAX(blocks) FROM game_boxscore)\nORDER BY p.player_name;\n\nBut wait, the user's example uses a GROUP BY. Maybe in this case, since a player could have multiple games with the same maximum, but we only need to list each player once with their maximum. Wait, but the user's question is about the highest number in a single game. So the max_nb_blocks is the highest value across all games. Then, the players are those who have achieved that value in at least one game. So each such player would have their name and the max_nb_blocks (which is the same for all). So the query can be written as:\n\nSELECT p.player_name, (SELECT MAX(blocks) FROM game_boxscore) AS max_nb_blocks\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nWHERE gb.blocks = (SELECT MAX(blocks) FROM game_boxscore)\nGROUP BY p.player_name\nORDER BY p.player_name;\n\nWait, but if a player has multiple games with the maximum blocks, grouping by player_name would aggregate them. But since we are selecting the max_nb_blocks as a constant (the overall max), grouping by player_name would ensure each player is listed once. But maybe the subquery can be used once. Let me structure it properly.\n\nAlternatively, first find the maximum blocks:\n\nWITH max_blocks AS (SELECT MAX(blocks) AS max_blocks FROM game_boxscore)\nSELECT p.player_name, mb.max_blocks AS max_nb_blocks\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nCROSS JOIN max_blocks mb\nWHERE gb.blocks = mb.max_blocks\nORDER BY p.player_name;\n\nBut maybe the user's example uses a different approach. Let me check the example again. The example's query groups by player_id and sums the minutes. Then orders and limits. But in this case, we are looking for the maximum in a single game, not the sum over games.\n\nSo the correct approach is to find the maximum blocks in any game, then find all player entries in game_boxscore where blocks equals that maximum, then select their names and the max value, ordered by name.\n\nSo the SQL query would be:\n\nSELECT p.player_name, gb.blocks AS max_nb_blocks\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nWHERE gb.blocks = (SELECT MAX(blocks) FROM game_boxscore)\nORDER BY p.player_name;\n\nBut wait, if multiple players have the same maximum, this query would return all of them. However, the user's example uses a LIMIT 1 when they want the top. But in this case, the user says \"if there is several players, return them all\". So no limit is needed. So the query is as above.\n\nBut wait, the user's example uses a GROUP BY. Maybe in this case, since the player could have multiple games with the same maximum, but we only need to list each player once. So perhaps grouping by player_name and taking the maximum of their blocks (which would be the same as the overall maximum). But that's redundant. Alternatively, since the WHERE clause already filters to only the rows where blocks is the maximum, grouping by player_name would ensure each player is listed once, even if they have multiple games with that maximum. But in that case, the max_nb_blocks would still be the same. So perhaps the query should be:\n\nSELECT p.player_name, MAX(gb.blocks) AS max_nb_blocks\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nWHERE gb.blocks = (SELECT MAX(blocks) FROM game_boxscore)\nGROUP BY p.player_name\nORDER BY p.player_name;\n\nBut wait, the WHERE clause already ensures that all gb.blocks are equal to the maximum. So taking MAX(gb.blocks) would just return that value. So this is redundant. But perhaps it's better to group by player_name to avoid duplicates if a player has multiple games with the maximum. But in that case, since the WHERE clause filters to only the maximum, each player would have entries only for games where they achieved the maximum. So grouping by player_name and taking the maximum would still be the same. But maybe the initial query without GROUP BY is sufficient. Let me think.\n\nSuppose a player has two games where they both scored the maximum blocks (say, 10 blocks in each game, and 10 is the overall max). Then, the WHERE clause would include both rows. The SELECT would list the player's name twice. But the user wants to return them all. Wait, but the user's question says \"return them all\". So if two players each have one game with the max, both are included. But if a player has two games with the max, would we list them twice? Probably not. The user wants each player once, with their maximum. But in this case, the maximum is the same for all, so each player is listed once. Wait, but the WHERE clause is filtering to all rows where blocks is the maximum. So if a player has two games with the maximum, they would appear twice in the result. But the user's example's output has player_name and max_nb_blocks. So perhaps the user wants each player once, with their maximum blocks in any single game. But since the maximum is the same for all, the query can be written to group by player and take the maximum of their blocks. But that would be:\n\nSELECT p.player_name, MAX(gb.blocks) AS max_nb_blocks\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nGROUP BY p.player_name\nHAVING MAX(gb.blocks) = (SELECT MAX(blocks) FROM game_boxscore)\nORDER BY p.player_name;\n\nThis way, for each player, we find their maximum blocks across all their games. Then, we filter to only those players whose maximum is equal to the overall maximum. This would handle cases where a player's maximum is the overall maximum, even if they have multiple games contributing to that maximum. But this approach uses a HAVING clause. This might be more accurate.\n\nWait, the original approach was to find all rows where blocks is the maximum. But if a player has multiple games with the maximum, they would appear multiple times. But the user's example's output shows player_name and max_nb_blocks. So if a player has two games with the same maximum, they would be listed twice. But the user's example's output groups by player. So perhaps the correct approach is to group by player and take the maximum of their blocks, then filter those maxima to the overall maximum.\n\nSo the query would be:\n\nSELECT p.player_name, MAX(gb.blocks) AS max_nb_blocks\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nGROUP BY p.player_name\nHAVING MAX(gb.blocks) = (SELECT MAX(blocks) FROM game_boxscore)\nORDER BY p.player_name;\n\nThis way, each player is listed once, with their maximum blocks (which is the overall maximum). This would correctly find all players whose maximum blocks in any game is the highest overall.\n\nBut wait, the user's question is about the highest number of blocks in a single game. So the answer is the maximum value of blocks in any game. Then, the players are those who have achieved that maximum in at least one game. So the HAVING clause approach is correct. Because for each player, we compute their maximum blocks across all their games. Then, we check if that maximum is equal to the overall maximum. If yes, include them.\n\nSo this approach would work. Let's structure the query accordingly.\n\nSo the SQL query would be:\n\nSELECT p.player_name, MAX(gb.blocks) AS max_nb_blocks\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nGROUP BY p.player_name\nHAVING MAX(gb.blocks) = (SELECT MAX(blocks) FROM game_boxscore)\nORDER BY p.player_name;\n\nBut wait, the subquery (SELECT MAX(blocks) FROM game_boxscore) is the overall maximum. So the HAVING clause checks if the player's maximum is equal to that. So this would include all players whose maximum blocks in any game is the overall maximum. That's correct.\n\nBut in the original approach, the WHERE clause filters to all rows where blocks is the maximum. Then, joining with player and selecting. But that would list each occurrence. For example, if a player has two games with the maximum, they would appear twice. But the user's example's output groups by player. So the HAVING approach is better.\n\nSo the correct query is the one with the GROUP BY and HAVING.\n\nNow, let's check the tables. The game_boxscore has player_id, which is joined with player.id. The blocks column is in game_boxscore. So the query is correct.\n\nSo the final SQL query is:\n\nSELECT p.player_name, MAX(gb.blocks) AS max_nb_blocks\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nGROUP BY p.player_name\nHAVING MAX(gb.blocks) = (SELECT MAX(blocks) FROM game_boxscore)\nORDER BY p.player_name;\n\nBut wait, the user's example uses the column names as specified. The user's example's output has player_name and sum_minutes_played. In this case, the columns are player_name and max_nb_blocks. So the query should select those columns.\n\nYes, this query should work. Let me test the syntax. The HAVING clause is after GROUP BY. The subquery is correctly placed. The ORDER BY is on player_name. So this should return the correct result.\n\u25c1/think\u25b7\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT p.player_name, MAX(gb.blocks) AS max_nb_blocks\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nGROUP BY p.player_name\nHAVING MAX(gb.blocks) = (SELECT MAX(blocks) FROM game_boxscore)\nORDER BY p.player_name;\n```\n</sql_query>",

The answer should be rounded to one decimal place.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which tables to use. The question is about games played per season for a specific player. The player_season table seems relevant because it has nb_games and season_id. The player table will be needed to filter by LeBron James's ID. Also, the season table might be useful to get the seasons within 2005-2015.\n\nWait, the player_season table has a player_id and season_id. So joining player_season with player on player_id would get LeBron's entries. Then, the season table's start_year or end_year can help filter the seasons between 2005 and 2015. Alternatively, maybe the season_id in player_season corresponds to the season's years. For example, if the season is 2005-2006, the season_id might be something like '2005' or a range. But looking at the season table, there's start_year and end_year. So perhaps joining player_season with season on season_id and then filtering where start_year >=2005 and end_year <=2015. Wait, but the seasons might span years. For example, the 2005-2006 season starts in 2005 and ends in 2006. So to include all seasons where the start_year is between 2005 and 2015 inclusive, maybe start_year >=2005 and start_year <=2015. Because the end_year would be start_year +1, but maybe not always. Alternatively, maybe the season's years are stored as a string like '2005-2006' in the years column. But the user's example uses start_year and end_year as BIGINT. Hmm.\n\nWait, the season table has start_year and end_year as BIGINT. So for each season, the start_year is the beginning of the season. For example, the 2005-2006 season would have start_year 2005. So to get seasons between 2005 and 2015 inclusive, we need start_year >=2005 and start_year <=2015. Because each season's start_year is the first year of the season. So 2005-2006 is start_year 2005, 2015-2016 is start_year 2015.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Join player_season with player to get LeBron's entries.\n2. Join player_season with season to get the start_year.\n3. Filter where start_year is between 2005 and 2015.\n4. Then calculate the average of nb_games for those seasons.\n5. Round the result to one decimal place.\n\nBut wait, the player_season table's nb_games is the number of games played in that season. So for each season in that range, sum the nb_games and divide by the number of seasons. Or maybe just average the nb_games. Since the user wants the average per season, it's the average of the nb_games across those seasons.\n\nSo the SQL query would be:\n\nSELECT ROUND(AVG(ps.nb_games), 1) AS avg_nb_games\nFROM player_season ps\nJOIN player p ON ps.player_id = p.id\nJOIN season s ON ps.season_id = s.id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'LeBron James'\nAND s.start_year >= 2005\nAND s.start_year <= 2015;\n\nWait, but maybe the player's name is stored with a different case, like 'lebron james' or 'LeBron James'. The user's example uses 'LeBron James', so assuming the player_name is stored as 'LeBron James'.\n\nBut maybe the player_season table has multiple entries for the same player and season? Probably not, since each row is a player-season combination. So each row in player_season is unique for a player and a season. So the nb_games for each row is the number of games played in that season. So averaging those nb_games for the specified seasons would give the correct average.\n\nSo the query would be:\n\nSELECT ROUND(AVG(ps.nb_games), 1) AS avg_nb_games\nFROM player_season ps\nJOIN player p ON ps.player_id = p.id\nJOIN season s ON ps.season_id = s.id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'LeBron James'\nAND s.start_year BETWEEN 2005 AND 2015;\n\nBut wait, the user's example uses \"included\", so 2005 and 2015 are included. So using BETWEEN 2005 AND 2015 is correct.\n\nBut maybe the season's end_year is relevant. For example, if a season starts in 2015 and ends in 2016, but the user wants up to 2015. But the user's question says \"between 2005 and 2015 included\", which refers to the calendar years. So perhaps the games played in those calendar years. But the seasons might span two calendar years. For example, the 2014-2015 season would have games from October 2014 to June 2015. So if the user wants games played in the calendar years 2005-2015, that would include parts of multiple seasons. But the data in player_season is per season, not per calendar year. So perhaps the user is asking for the average number of games per season for the seasons that started between 2005 and 2015. Because each season is a span, but the start_year is the first year. So for example, the 2005-2006 season starts in 2005, which is included. The 2015-2016 season starts in 2015, which is included. So the seasons with start_year from 2005 to 2015 inclusive.\n\nSo the query is correct as written.\n\nBut wait, the player_season table's nb_games is the number of games played in that season. So for each season in that range, we take the nb_games, average them, and round to one decimal.\n\nSo the SQL query would be:\n\nSELECT ROUND(AVG(ps.nb_games), 1) AS avg_nb_games\nFROM player_season ps\nJOIN player p ON ps.player_id = p.id\nJOIN season s ON ps.season_id = s.id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'LeBron James'\nAND s.start_year BETWEEN 2005 AND 2015;\n\nBut maybe the player's name is stored in a different case. But assuming the data is stored as 'LeBron James', this should work.\n\nAnother thing to check: the player_season table's nb_games is a BIGINT. So averaging that should be okay. The ROUND function with 1 decimal place would format it correctly.\n\nSo the final SQL query is as above.\n\u25c1/think\u25b7\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT ROUND(AVG(ps.nb_games), 1) AS avg_nb_games\nFROM player_season ps\nJOIN player p ON ps.player_id = p.id\nJOIN season s ON ps.season_id = s.id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'LeBron James'\nAND s.start_year BETWEEN 2005 AND 2015;\n```\n</sql_query>",

The user wants to know the average number of three-point attempts per player per game for each calendar year between 2005 and 2007 inclusive. The result should include the calendar_year and the average rounded to one decimal place.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which tables to use. The three-point attempts data is probably in the game_boxscore table because that's where individual game stats are stored. The game_summary table has the date of each game, which is necessary to filter by calendar year. The player table might not be needed here since we're focusing on player IDs and their stats.\n\nSo, the plan is to join game_boxscore with game_summary on game_id to get the date. Then, group by the year extracted from the date and calculate the average three_pts_attempts per player per game. Wait, but how do we get per player per game? Because each row in game_boxscore is a player's stats for a specific game. So, for each player in each game, their three_pts_attempts is recorded. To find the average per player per game, we can just take the average of three_pts_attempts across all player-game entries for each year.\n\nWait, but maybe the user wants the average per player per game, which would be the total three-point attempts divided by the number of games played by each player. But the way the question is phrased, \"average number of three point attempts per player per game\" might mean the average across all player-games. So, for each year, sum all three_pts_attempts and divide by the total number of player-games (i.e., the count of rows in game_boxscore for that year). That would give the average per player per game.\n\nSo the calculation would be: SUM(three_pts_attempts) / COUNT(*) for each year. But wait, that's the total attempts divided by the number of player-games. But each player-game is a single row. So if a player played in 50 games, each of those 50 games would have their three_pts_attempts recorded. So summing all those and dividing by the total number of rows gives the average per player per game.\n\nSo the SQL would be:\n\nSELECT \n    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) AS calendar_year,\n    ROUND(AVG(gb.three_pts_attempts), 1) AS avg_nb_3pt_attempts\nFROM \n    game_boxscore gb\nJOIN \n    game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\nWHERE \n    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) BETWEEN 2005 AND 2007\nGROUP BY \n    calendar_year\nORDER BY \n    calendar_year;\n\nWait, but the user wants the average per player per game. The AVG function here would calculate the average three_pts_attempts per row, which is per player per game. Because each row is a player's stats for a single game. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the user's example uses SUM in the example, but here we need AVG. Let me check. The example was about summing minutes, but here it's about averaging three-point attempts. So using AVG is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Join game_boxscore and game_summary on game_id.\n2. Filter where the year is between 2005 and 2007.\n3. Group by the extracted year.\n4. Calculate the average of three_pts_attempts for each group.\n5. Round to one decimal place.\n\nBut wait, the user's example uses extract(year from gs.date = 2010), but that's a typo. The correct syntax is EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) = 2010. So in the WHERE clause, it should be EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) BETWEEN 2005 AND 2007.\n\nAlso, the column names: in game_boxscore, the column is three_pts_attempts. So that's the correct field to use.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nSELECT \n    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) AS calendar_year,\n    ROUND(AVG(gb.three_pts_attempts), 1) AS avg_nb_3pt_attempts\nFROM \n    game_boxscore gb\nJOIN \n    game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\nWHERE \n    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) BETWEEN 2005 AND 2007\nGROUP BY \n    calendar_year\nORDER BY \n    calendar_year;\n\nBut wait, the user's example uses \"extract(year from gs.date = 2010)\", which is incorrect.

The three-point attempts are likely in the game_boxscore table, which has a column called three_pts_attempts. That's per player per game. But the user wants the total for the entire team per game.

So for each team in each year, the average per game is the sum of all three-point attempts in all games divided by the number of games.\n\nWait, but the user wants the average per game. So for each game, the team's total is the sum of all players' three_pts_attempts. Then, for each year, average that sum across all games. So the average per game for the team in that year is the total three-point attempts in all games divided by the number of games.\n\nBut the user's question is about the entire team's average per game. So the calculation is: for each team in each year, sum all three-point attempts across all games and divide by the number of games played in that year.\n\nWait, but how do we get the number of games played by the team in each year? The game_summary has home_team_id and away_team_id. So each game is counted once, but each team plays in two games (home and away). Wait, no. Each game has one home team and one away team. So for a particular team, the number of games they played in a year is the count of games where they are either the home_team or the away_team.\n\nBut in the game_boxscore, each row is a player's stats for a game. So for each game, each team has multiple players. So to get the team's total three-point attempts for a game, we sum the three_pts_attempts for all players on that team in that game.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each game and each team, calculate the sum of three_pts_attempts for all players on that team. This gives the team's total three-point attempts for that game.\n\n2. For each team and each calendar year, calculate the average of these sums across all games played by the team in that year.\n\nBut how to get the games per team per year? The game_summary has the date, and the home and away team IDs. So for each game, we can check if the team is the home or away team. But maybe the game_boxscore already has the team_id for each player's entry. Wait, looking at the game_boxscore table, there's a team_id column. So each row in game_boxscore is for a player on a specific team in a specific game. So for a given game_id, there are multiple team_ids (probably two, home and away). Wait, no. In a single game, each team has their own players. So for a game, there are two team_ids. So in the game_boxscore, for each game, there are entries for players from both teams. So for each team in the game, we can sum the three_pts_attempts of their players.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Group the game_boxscore by game_id, team_id, and then sum the three_pts_attempts. This gives the team's total three-point attempts for that game.\n\nThen, for each team and each year, average these sums across all games in that year.\n\nBut how to get the year? The game_summary has the date. So we need to join game_boxscore with game_summary on game_id to get the date, then extract the year.\n\nSo the SQL steps would be:\n\n1. Join game_boxscore (gb) with game_summary (gs) on gb.game_id = gs.id.\n\n2. Group by gb.team_id, gs.date (or extract year from gs.date), and gb.game_id to sum three_pts_attempts.\n\nWait, but for each game, the team's total is the sum of all players' three_pts_attempts. So for each game and team, sum the three_pts_attempts.\n\nThen, for each team and year, average those sums.\n\nSo the query would be:\n\nSELECT team_id, calendar_year, AVG(team_3pt_attempts) as avg_nb_3pt_attempts\n\nFROM (\n\n    SELECT gb.team_id, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) as calendar_year, gb.game_id, SUM(gb.three_pts_attempts) as team_3pt_attempts\n\n    FROM game_boxscore gb\n\n    JOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\n\n    GROUP BY gb.team_id, gs.date, gb.game_id\n\n) as subquery\n\nWHERE calendar_year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015\n\nGROUP BY team_id, calendar_year\n\nORDER BY calendar_year, team_id\n\nBut wait, the user wants the average per game for each team in each year. So for each team in each year, the average is the sum of team_3pt_attempts across all games in that year divided by the number of games.\n\nBut in the subquery, for each game and team, we have the sum of three_pts_attempts for that team in that game. Then, for each team and year, we average those sums.\n\nSo the outer query groups by team_id and calendar_year, and averages the team_3pt_attempts.\n\nBut the user's question is about the average total number of three-point attempts per game for the entire team. So for each game, the team's total is the sum of all players' three-point attempts. Then, average that sum across all games in the year.\n\nSo the query would be:\n\nSELECT calendar_year, AVG(team_3pt_attempts) as avg_nb_3pt_attempts\n\nFROM (\n\n    SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) as calendar_year, gb.team_id, SUM(gb.three_pts_attempts) as team_3pt_attempts\n\n    FROM game_boxscore gb\n\n    JOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\n\n    GROUP BY calendar_year, gb.team_id, gs.date\n\n) as subquery\n\nWHERE calendar_year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015\n\nGROUP BY calendar_year\n\nWait, but the user wants the average per team per year. Wait, the original question says: \"average total number of three point attempts for the entire team per game, for every calendar year between 2010 and 2015 included\". So for each calendar year, the average across all teams' per-game three-point attempts. Or is it per team per year?\n\nWait, the user's question is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read it.\n\nThe user is asking for the average total number of three-point attempts for the entire team per game, for every calendar year between 2010 and 2015. So for each year, what is the average (across all teams) of the total three-point attempts per game for each team.\n\nWait, maybe the user wants, for each year, the average of the per-game three-point attempts for all teams. So for each team, calculate their average per game, then average that across all teams for the year.\n\nBut the user's question says \"average total number of three point attempts for the entire team per game\". So for each team, in each game, the total is the sum of all players' three-point attempts. Then, for each team, average that sum across all games they played in the year. Then, for each year, average those team averages.\n\nBut the user's question might be simpler. Maybe they want, for each year, the average (across all games) of the team's total three-point attempts per game. Since each game has two teams, but the user is asking for the entire team's attempts. Wait, but the user's question is about the entire team's attempts per game. So for each game, each team has a certain number of three-point attempts. The user wants the average of those numbers across all games in the year, for each team. But the user's answer should return the calendar_year and the average. So perhaps the user wants the average across all teams in each year.\n\nWait, the user's example response includes columns calendar_year and avg_nb_3pt_attempts. So the answer is per year, not per team. So for each year, the average three-point attempts per game across all teams.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For each game and each team, calculate the sum of three_pts_attempts (team's total for that game).\n\n2. For each year, average those sums across all games (regardless of team).\n\nWait, but that would include both teams in each game. So for each game, there are two teams, each with their own sum. So in the subquery, for each game, there are two rows (one for each team). Then, when averaging, we are including both teams' sums for each game. But that might not be correct. Because each game is counted once, but each team's sum is added. So for each game, the total three-point attempts for both teams would be the sum of both teams' sums. But the user is asking for the entire team's attempts per game. So perhaps the user wants the average per team per game, then averaged across all teams in the year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants the average per game, per team, across all teams and games in the year. So for each game and team, we have the sum. Then, average all those sums for the year.\n\nBut how to structure the query.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe user wants the average total number of three-point attempts for the entire team per game. So for each game, the team's total is the sum of all players' three-point attempts. Then, for each team, average that sum across all games they played in the year. Then, for each year, average those team averages.\n\nBut the user's answer should return the calendar_year and the average. So the answer is per year, not per team. So the user wants the average across all teams in each year.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For each game and each team, calculate the sum of three_pts_attempts.\n\n2. For each team and each year, calculate the average of these sums across all games they played in that year.\n\n3. For each year, average those team averages.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the average per game across all teams in the year. So for each game, take the average of the two teams' sums, then average across all games. Or sum all teams' sums and divide by the total number of game-team combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the average per game, per team, across all games in the year. So for each team, calculate their average per game, then average that across all teams for the year.\n\nBut how to implement this in SQL.\n\nLet's try to structure the query.\n\nFirst, create a subquery that, for each game and team, sums the three_pts_attempts.\n\nThen, for each team and year, average those sums.\n\nThen, for each year, average those team averages.\n\nBut how to do that in SQL.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the average per game across all teams in the year. So for each game, sum the three_pts_attempts for both teams, then average across all games. But that would be the total three-point attempts per game (both teams). But the user's question is about the entire team's attempts per game. So maybe the user wants the average per team per game.\n\nWait, the user's question says \"average total number of three point attempts for the entire team per game\". So for each team, in each game, the total is the sum of their players' three-point attempts. Then, average that sum across all games for that team in the year. Then, for each year, average those team averages.\n\nBut the user's answer should return the calendar_year and the average. So the answer is per year, not per team. So the user wants the average across all teams in each year.\n\nSo the query would be:\n\nSELECT calendar_year, AVG(avg_team_3pt_attempts) as avg_nb_3pt_attempts\n\nFROM (\n\n    SELECT calendar_year, team_id, AVG(team_3pt_attempts) as avg_team_3pt_attempts\n\n    FROM (\n\n        SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) as calendar_year, gb.team_id, SUM(gb.three_pts_attempts) as team_3pt_attempts\n\n        FROM game_boxscore gb\n\n        JOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\n\n        GROUP BY calendar_year, gb.team_id, gs.date\n\n    ) as game_team_sums\n\n    GROUP BY calendar_year, team_id\n\n) as team_year_averages\n\nWHERE calendar_year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015\n\nGROUP BY calendar_year\n\nBut this might be overcomplicating. Let's think of a simpler approach.\n\nThe user wants the average total three-point attempts per game for each team in each year. But the answer should be per year. So perhaps the user wants the average across all teams in each year.\n\nSo for each year, sum all three-point attempts across all games and teams, then divide by the total number of games in that year. But that would give the average per game across all teams. Wait, but each game has two teams. So the total three-point attempts per game would be the sum of both teams' attempts. But the user's question is about the entire team's attempts per game. So maybe the user wants the average per team per game.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the average per game, per team, across all teams and games. So for each game and team, sum the three-point attempts, then average all those sums.\n\nSo the query would be:\n\nSELECT calendar_year, AVG(team_3pt_attempts) as avg_nb_3pt_attempts\n\nFROM (\n\n    SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) as calendar_year, gb.team_id, SUM(gb.three_pts_attempts) as team_3pt_attempts\n\n    FROM game_boxscore gb\n\n    JOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\n\n    GROUP BY calendar_year, gb.team_id, gs.date\n\n) as subquery\n\nWHERE calendar_year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015\n\nGROUP BY calendar_year\n\nBut this would average the team's total per game across all games in the year, then average those averages across all teams. Wait, no. The subquery gives for each game and team, the sum. Then, the outer query groups by calendar_year and averages those sums. But that would be summing all the team's attempts across all games and teams, then dividing by the number of game-team entries. But each game has two teams, so for each game in the year, there are two entries. So the average would be (sum of all team attempts in all games) / (2 * number of games). But that's not the average per team per game.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to sum the three_pts_attempts for each team in each game, then average across all games for that team in the year. Then, average those team averages for the year.\n\nBut how to do that in SQL.\n\nThe inner query would be:\n\nSELECT calendar_year, team_id, game_id, SUM(three_pts_attempts) as team_3pt_attempts\n\nFROM game_boxscore gb\n\nJOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\n\nGROUP BY calendar_year, team_id, game_id\n\nThen, for each team and year, average the team_3pt_attempts:\n\nSELECT calendar_year, team_id, AVG(team_3pt_attempts) as avg_team_3pt_attempts\n\nFROM (\n\n    ... inner query ...\n\n) as subquery\n\nGROUP BY calendar_year, team_id\n\nThen, for each year, average the avg_team_3pt_attempts across all teams:\n\nSELECT calendar_year, AVG(avg_team_3pt_attempts) as avg_nb_3pt_attempts\n\nFROM (\n\n    ... previous query ...\n\n) as team_averages\n\nWHERE calendar_year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015\n\nGROUP BY calendar_year\n\nBut this requires three levels of subqueries, which might be complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's question is simpler. They want the average per game of the team's total three-point attempts, across all games in the year, for each team. But the answer should return the year and the average. So perhaps the user wants the average across all teams in each year.\n\nSo the query would be:\n\nSELECT calendar_year, AVG(team_3pt_attempts) as avg_nb_3pt_attempts\n\nFROM (\n\n    SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) as calendar_year, gb.team_id, SUM(gb.three_pts_attempts) as team_3pt_attempts\n\n    FROM game_boxscore gb\n\n    JOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\n\n    GROUP BY calendar_year, gb.team_id, gs.date\n\n) as subquery\n\nWHERE calendar_year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015\n\nGROUP BY calendar_year\n\nBut this would sum the team's three-point attempts for each game, then average those sums across all games in the year. But since each game has two teams, the subquery would have two entries per game. So the average would be the sum of all team attempts in all games divided by the number of game-team entries (which is 2 * number of games). So the average would be (sum of all team attempts) / (2 * number of games). But the user wants the average per game for each team. So for each team, the average is their sum divided by their number of games. Then, average those team averages across all teams in the year.\n\nBut this approach would not account for teams playing different numbers of games. But in the NBA, each team plays the same number of games per season (82 in regular season), but maybe in the given data, it's different. But the user's question is about the calendar year, which might include multiple seasons. For example, the 2010 calendar year includes the 2009-2010 season. So the data might have games from multiple seasons in a calendar year.\n\nBut the user's question is about the calendar year, not the season. So the query needs to group by the calendar year.\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\nFor each team and calendar year, calculate the average three-point attempts per game (sum of three_pts_attempts for all games in the year divided by number of games). Then, for each calendar year, average those team averages.\n\nBut how to implement this in SQL.\n\nThe steps would be:\n\n1. For each game and team, sum the three_pts_attempts.\n\n2. For each team and calendar year, sum those sums and divide by the number of games played by the team in that year.\n\n3. For each calendar year, average those team averages.\n\nBut how to get the number of games played by the team in the year. The game_summary has home_team_id and away_team_id. So for each team, the number of games in the year is the count of games where they are either home or away.\n\nBut in the game_boxscore, for each game, there are entries for both teams. So for each team and game, there are entries. So the number of games for a team in a year is the count of distinct game_ids where the team_id is present.\n\nSo the query would be:\n\nSELECT calendar_year, AVG(avg_team_3pt_attempts) as avg_nb_3pt_attempts\n\nFROM (\n\n    SELECT calendar_year, team_id, SUM(team_3pt_attempts) / COUNT(DISTINCT game_id) as avg_team_3pt_attempts\n\n    FROM (\n\n        SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) as calendar_year, gb.team_id, gb.game_id, SUM(gb.three_pts_attempts) as team_3pt_attempts\n\n        FROM game_boxscore gb\n\n        JOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\n\n        GROUP BY calendar_year, gb.team_id, gb.game_id\n\n    ) as game_team_sums\n\n    WHERE calendar_year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015\n\n    GROUP BY calendar_year, team_id\n\n) as team_year_averages\n\nGROUP BY calendar_year\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the average per game across all games in the year, regardless of team. So for each game, sum the three-point attempts of both teams, then average across all games in the year.\n\nBut the user's question is about the entire team's attempts per game. So for each game, each team has their own sum. The user wants the average of those sums per game, per team. So for each game, there are two sums (home and away teams). The average per game would be the sum of both teams' sums divided by 2. Then, average that across all games in the year.\n\nBut that's not what the user is asking. The user wants the average per game for each team. So for each team, their average per game, then average across all teams in the year.\n\nBut this is getting too ambiguous. Let's look at the example response provided by the user.\n\nIn the example, the user's query returns the player with the most minutes played in 2010. The SQL query joins player, game_boxscore, and game_summary, filters by year, sums the minutes, orders by descending, and limits to 1.\n\nIn the current problem, the user wants the average three-point attempts per game for each team in each year between 2010 and 2015. The answer should return the calendar_year and the average, rounded to one decimal place.\n\nSo the SQL query should:\n\n- Join game_boxscore with game_summary to get the date.\n\n- Sum the three_pts_attempts for each team in each game.\n\n- Group by calendar_year, team_id, and game_id to get the sum per game per team.\n\n- Then, for each team and calendar_year, average those sums.\n\n- Then, for each calendar_year, average those team averages.\n\nBut how to structure this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the average per game across all teams in the year. So for each game, sum the three_pts_attempts for all players (both teams), then average across all games in the year.\n\nBut the user's question specifies \"entire team per game\", which suggests per team per game.\n\nBut the user's answer should return the calendar_year and the average. So the answer is per year, not per team. So the user wants the average across all teams in each year.\n\nSo the query would be:\n\nSELECT calendar_year, ROUND(AVG(team_3pt_attempts), 1) as avg_nb_3pt_attempts\n\nFROM (\n\n    SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) as calendar_year, gb.team_id, SUM(gb.three_pts_attempts) as team_3pt_attempts\n\n    FROM game_boxscore gb\n\n    JOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\n\n    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015\n\n    GROUP BY calendar_year, gb.team_id, gs.date\n\n) as subquery\n\nGROUP BY calendar_year\n\nORDER BY calendar_year\n\nBut this would average the team's total three-point attempts per game across all games in the year, then average those averages across all teams in the year. But this approach would weight each team equally, even if they played different numbers of games. But in reality, each team in the NBA plays the same number of games per season, but the calendar year might include parts of multiple seasons.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to sum all three-point attempts for all teams in the year and divide by the total number of games played in the year. But each game is counted once, but each game has two teams. So the sum would be the total three-point attempts for both teams in the game. Then, the average per game would be sum / number of games. But the user's question is about the entire team's attempts per game. So for each game, the team's total is the sum of their players' attempts. Then, average that sum across all games in the year, for each team. Then, average those team averages for the year.\n\nBut this is getting too involved. Let's try to write the SQL query step by step.\n\nFirst, create a subquery that, for each game and team, sums the three_pts_attempts:\n\nSELECT gb.game_id, gb.team_id, SUM(gb.three_pts_attempts) as team_3pt_attempts\n\nFROM game_boxscore gb\n\nGROUP BY gb.game_id, gb.team_id\n\nThen, join this with game_summary to get the date and extract the year:\n\nSELECT gs.date, sub.team_id, sub.team_3pt_attempts\n\nFROM game_summary gs\n\nJOIN (\n\n    ... previous subquery ...\n\n) as sub ON sub.game_id = gs.id\n\nThen, extract the year:\n\nSELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) as calendar_year, sub.team_id, sub.team_3pt_attempts\n\nFROM ... \n\nThen, for each team and year, average the team_3pt_attempts:\n\nSELECT calendar_year, team_id, AVG(team_3pt_attempts) as avg_team_3pt_attempts\n\nFROM (\n\n    ... previous subquery ...\n\n) as sub2\n\nGROUP BY calendar_year, team_id\n\nThen, for each year, average the avg_team_3pt_attempts:\n\nSELECT calendar_year, AVG(avg_team_3pt_attempts) as avg_nb_3pt_attempts\n\nFROM (\n\n    ... previous subquery ...\n\n) as sub3\n\nWHERE calendar_year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015\n\nGROUP BY calendar_year\n\nBut this requires multiple levels of subqueries. Let's try to write this in SQL.\n\nThe final query would be:\n\nSELECT calendar_year, ROUND(AVG(avg_team_3pt_attempts), 1) as avg_nb_3pt_attempts\n\nFROM (\n\n    SELECT calendar_year, team_id, AVG(team_3pt_attempts) as avg_team_3pt_attempts\n\n    FROM (\n\n        SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) as calendar_year, gb.team_id, SUM(gb.three_pts_attempts) as team_3pt_attempts\n\n        FROM game_boxscore gb\n\n        JOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\n\n        WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015\n\n        GROUP BY calendar_year, gb.team_id, gs.date\n\n    ) as game_team_sums\n\n    GROUP BY calendar_year, team_id\n\n) as team_year_averages\n\nGROUP BY calendar_year\n\nORDER BY calendar_year\n\nBut this might be correct. Let's check the structure.\n\nThe innermost subquery (game_team_sums) groups by calendar_year, team_id, and date (which is unique per game), summing the three_pts_attempts for each team in each game. Then, for each team and year, average those sums. Then, for each year, average those team averages. This gives the average per team per year, then averaged across all teams in the year.\n\nBut the user's question says \"average total number of three point attempts for the entire team per game\". So for each team, the average per game is the sum of their three-point attempts in all games divided by the number of games. Then, for each year, average those team averages.\n\nBut the user's answer should return the calendar_year and the average. So the query above would do that.\n\nBut the user also wants the result rounded to one decimal place. So using ROUND(AVG(avg_team_3pt_attempts), 1).\n\nBut in the example response, the user used ROUND to 0.1, which is one decimal place. So the query should include that.\n\nPutting it all together, the SQL query would be:\n\nSELECT calendar_year, ROUND(AVG(avg_team_3pt_attempts), 1) as avg_nb_3pt_attempts\n\nFROM (\n\n    SELECT calendar_year, team_id, AVG(team_3pt_attempts) as avg_team_3pt_attempts\n\n    FROM (\n\n        SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) as calendar_year, gb.team_id, SUM(gb.three_pts_attempts) as team_3pt_attempts\n\n        FROM game_boxscore gb\n\n        JOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\n\n        WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015\n\n        GROUP BY calendar_year, gb.team_id, gs.date\n\n    ) as game_team_sums\n\n    GROUP BY calendar_year, team_id\n\n) as team_year_averages\n\nGROUP BY calendar_year\n\nORDER BY calendar_year\n\nBut wait, the WHERE clause in the innermost subquery filters the years between 2010 and 2015. But the user's question says \"between 2010 and 2015 included\". So the WHERE clause should be:\n\nWHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the example response, the user used extract(year from gs.date = 2010), which is a typo. It should be extract(year from gs.date) = 2010. So in the actual query, the syntax is important.\n\nSo the correct SQL would be:\n\nSELECT calendar_year, ROUND(AVG(avg_team_3pt_attempts), 1) as avg_nb_3pt_attempts\n\nFROM (\n\n    SELECT calendar_year, team_id, AVG(team_3pt_attempts) as avg_team_3pt_attempts\n\n    FROM (\n\n        SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) as calendar_year, gb.team_id, SUM(gb.three_pts_attempts) as team_3pt_attempts\n\n        FROM game_boxscore gb\n\n        JOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\n\n        WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015\n\n        GROUP BY calendar_year, gb.team_id, gs.date\n\n    ) as game_team_sums\n\n    GROUP BY calendar_year, team_id\n\n) as team_year_averages\n\nGROUP BY calendar_year\n\nORDER BY calendar_year\n\nBut this is a bit complex. Let's check the structure again.\n\nThe innermost subquery (game_team_sums) calculates for each game (date) and team, the sum of three_pts_attempts. Then, groups by calendar_year, team_id, and date (which is unique per game), summing the three_pts_attempts. Then, the next level (team_year_averages) groups by calendar_year and team_id, averaging the team_3pt_attempts (which is the sum per game). So this gives the average per game for each team in each year. Then, the outer query averages those averages across all teams in each year.\n\nBut the user's question might not require averaging across teams. Maybe the user wants the average per game for each team in each year. But the answer should return the calendar_year and the average. So the user wants the average across all teams in each year.\n\nSo the query is correct.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way. For example, sum all three-point attempts for all teams in the year and divide by the total number of games played in the year. But each game is counted once, but each game has two teams. So the sum would be the total for both teams. But the user's question is about the entire team's attempts per game. So for each game, each team has their own sum. The average per game for each team is their sum divided by their number of games. Then, average those team averages for the year.\n\nBut this approach is more accurate.\n\nSo the final SQL query is as above.\n\u25c1/think\u25b7\n\n```sql\nSELECT calendar_year, ROUND(AVG(avg_team_3pt_attempts), 1) as avg_nb_3pt_attempts\nFROM (\n    SELECT calendar_year, team_id, AVG(team_3pt_attempts) as avg_team_3pt_attempts\n    FROM (\n        SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) as calendar_year, gb.team_id, SUM(gb.three_pts_attempts) as team_3pt_attempts\n        FROM game_boxscore gb\n        JOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\n        WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015\n        GROUP BY calendar_year, gb.team_id, gs.date\n    ) as game_team_sums\n    GROUP BY calendar_year, team_id\n) as team_year_averages\nGROUP BY calendar_year\nORDER BY calendar_year\n```",

                "llm_response": "\u25c1think\u25b7Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know which player scored the most points on average per season for each year between 2005 and 2007. The result should include the season_start_year, player_name, and avg_points rounded to two decimal places, ordered by season_start_year.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which tables to use. The question is about average points per season, so the player_season table probably has that information. The player_season table has an avg_points column, which is exactly what we need. Then, we need to link that to the season table to get the start_year, and the player table to get the player's name.\n\nLooking at the tables provided, the player_season table has a season_id, which should correspond to the season table's id. The season table has start_year, which is part of the required output. The player_season also has player_id, which links to the player table's id. So the plan is to join player_season with season and player.\n\nThe user specified years 2005-2007, so we need to filter the seasons where start_year is between those years. Then, for each season, find the player with the highest avg_points. But wait, the user wants the most points per season for each year. Wait, maybe each season corresponds to a year range. For example, the 2005-2006 season might have start_year 2005 and end_year 2006. So the user is asking for each season that starts between 2005 and 2007.\n\nWait, the question says \"each year between 2005 and 2007\". So maybe each individual calendar year. But seasons in basketball typically span two calendar years. For example, the 2005-2006 season starts in 2005 and ends in 2006. So if the user wants data for each calendar year 2005, 2006, 2007, perhaps we need to aggregate based on the game dates. But the problem mentions \"per season\", so maybe the user is referring to each season that starts in those years. For example, the 2005 season (if such a thing exists), but in reality, NBA seasons are like 2005-2006. So maybe the user wants for each season where the start_year is 2005, 2006, or 2007.\n\nWait, the season table has start_year and end_year. So perhaps the user is asking for each season that starts between 2005 and 2007. For example, the 2005-2006 season (start_year 2005), 2006-2007 (start_year 2006), and 2007-2008 (start_year 2007). But the user's question says \"each year between 2005 and 2007\", which might be inclusive. So start_years 2005, 2006, 2007.\n\nSo the first step is to filter the seasons where start_year is between 2005 and 2007. Then, for each of those seasons, find the player with the highest avg_points. But wait, the user wants the average points per season for each year. Wait, maybe the user wants, for each calendar year (2005, 2006, 2007), the player who had the highest average points in their season(s) that overlap with that year. But that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the user is considering the season as the unit, and wants for each season (2005-2006, 2006-2007, 2007-2008) the top scorer in that season. But the user's question says \"each year between 2005 and 2007\", which might be each individual year. Hmm, maybe the user is using \"year\" to refer to the season's start year. So for each start_year in 2005, 2006, 2007, find the player with the highest avg_points in that season.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Join player_season with season on season_id, and player on player_id.\n2. Filter where season.start_year is between 2005 and 2007.\n3. For each start_year, find the player with the maximum avg_points.\n4. Return the start_year, player_name, and avg_points rounded to two decimal places, ordered by start_year.\n\nBut how to get the maximum per group? We can use a window function or a subquery. Let's think. One way is to group by start_year and player, then order by start_year and avg_points desc, then take the first row for each start_year. Alternatively, use a window function to rank players within each start_year group.\n\nWait, but the user wants the player with the highest average per season (i.e., per start_year). So for each start_year in 2005, 2006, 2007, find the player with the highest avg_points in that season.\n\nSo the SQL would be something like:\n\nSELECT s.start_year, p.player_name, ROUND(ps.avg_points, 2) as avg_points\nFROM player_season ps\nJOIN season s ON ps.season_id = s.id\nJOIN player p ON ps.player_id = p.id\nWHERE s.start_year BETWEEN 2005 AND 2007\nAND ps.avg_points = (\n    SELECT MAX(ps2.avg_points)\n    FROM player_season ps2\n    JOIN season s2 ON ps2.season_id = s2.id\n    WHERE s2.start_year = s.start_year\n)\nORDER BY s.start_year;\n\nBut this approach uses a subquery for each row, which might be inefficient. Alternatively, using a window function to rank the players by avg_points within each start_year group.\n\nAnother approach is to use a window function to get the rank of each player within their season. For example:\n\nWITH ranked_players AS (\n    SELECT s.start_year, p.player_name, ps.avg_points,\n           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.start_year ORDER BY ps.avg_points DESC) as rank\n    FROM player_season ps\n    JOIN season s ON ps.season_id = s.id\n    JOIN player p ON ps.player_id = p.id\n    WHERE s.start_year BETWEEN 2005 AND 2007\n)\nSELECT start_year, player_name, ROUND(avg_points, 2) as avg_points\nFROM ranked_players\nWHERE rank = 1\nORDER BY start_year;\n\nThis way, for each start_year, we rank the players by avg_points descending, and take the top one. Then round the avg_points to two decimal places.\n\nBut wait, the user's example shows using extract(year from date), but in this case, the season table already has start_year. So using the start_year from the season table is more straightforward.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Join player_season, season, and player tables.\n2. Filter seasons where start_year is between 2005 and 2007.\n3. Rank players within each start_year group by avg_points descending.\n4. Select the top-ranked player for each start_year.\n5. Round avg_points to two decimal places.\n6. Order by start_year.\n\nNow, checking the table schemas. The player_season table has avg_points as a DOUBLE. The season table has start_year as BIGINT. The player table has player_name as VARCHAR.\n\nSo the SQL query would be:\n\nWITH ranked_players AS (\n    SELECT \n        s.start_year,\n        p.player_name,\n        ps.avg_points,\n        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.start_year ORDER BY ps.avg_points DESC) as rank\n    FROM \n        player_season ps\n    INNER JOIN \n        season s ON ps.season_id = s.id\n    INNER JOIN \n        player p ON ps.player_id = p.id\n    WHERE \n        s.start_year BETWEEN 2005 AND 2007\n)\nSELECT \n    start_year,\n    player_name,\n    ROUND(avg_points, 2) as avg_points\nFROM \n    ranked_players\nWHERE \n    rank = 1\nORDER BY \n    start_year;\n\nBut wait, the user's example uses the thinking tag. Let me structure the response accordingly.\n\nIn the thinking part, I need to outline the steps:\n\n- The required columns are season_start_year (from season.start_year), player_name (from player.player_name), and avg_points (from player_season.avg_points).\n- The tables to join are player_season, season, and player.\n- The filtering is on season.start_year between 2005 and 2007.\n- For each start_year, find the player with the highest avg_points.\n- Use a window function to rank players within each start_year group.\n- Select the top rank (1) and round avg_points to two decimal places.\n\nSo the SQL query would be as above.\n\nBut wait, the user's example uses the game_boxscore and other tables. But in this case, the player_season table already has the avg_points, which is the average per season. So using that table is more efficient.\n\nTherefore, the correct SQL query is:\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nWITH ranked_players AS (\n    SELECT \n        s.start_year,\n        p.player_name,\n        ps.avg_points,\n        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.start_year ORDER BY ps.avg_points DESC) as rank\n    FROM \n        player_season ps\n    INNER JOIN \n        season s ON ps.season_id = s.id\n    INNER JOIN \n        player p ON ps.player_id = p.id\n    WHERE \n        s.start_year BETWEEN 2005 AND 2007\n)\nSELECT \n    start_year,\n    player_name,\n    ROUND(avg_points, 2) as avg_points\nFROM \n    ranked_players\nWHERE \n    rank = 1\nORDER BY \n    start_year;\n```\n</sql_query>\n\nBut wait, the user's example uses the thinking tag.

The user wants the top 5 teams from the 2022 season based on winning percentage, returning only the team names. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out where the winning percentages are stored. Looking at the tables provided, there's a team_season table which has a column called pct_game_win. That seems relevant. The team_season table also has a season_id, so I can filter by the season that started in 2022.\n\nWait, the season table has start_year and end_year. So I need to find the season_id where start_year is 2022. Then, join team_season with season where season_id matches, and filter for start_year = 2022.\n\nBut the user wants the top 5 teams by winning percentage. So I need to order the results by pct_game_win in descending order and limit to 5. Also, the team names are in the team table, so I need to join team_season with team to get the team_name.\n\nWait, looking at the tables, there's a team table and a team_bis table. Both have team_name. Maybe they are duplicates? But the team_season references team_id, so probably the team table is the correct one. So team_season's team_id joins to team's id.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Join team_season with season on season_id.\n2. Filter where season.start_year = 2022.\n3. Join team_season with team to get team_name.\n4. Order by pct_game_win DESC.\n5. Limit to 5 results.\n\nBut wait, the team_season's pct_game_win is the winning percentage. So that's the column we need. So the SQL query would be something like:\n\nSELECT t.team_name\nFROM team_season ts\nJOIN season s ON ts.season_id = s.id\nJOIN team t ON ts.team_id = t.id\nWHERE s.start_year = 2022\nORDER BY ts.pct_game_win DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n\nBut I need to check the table structures. The team_season table has team_id, season_id, and pct_game_win. The season table has start_year. The team table has team_name. So that should work.\n\nWait, but maybe the season_id in team_season is a foreign key to the season table. So joining on ts.season_id = s.id is correct. Then, filtering where s.start_year = 2022.\n\nBut what about the team_bis table? The user provided both team and team_bis. Maybe team_bis is a duplicate or a different version. But the problem statement says to use the schema as given. Since the team table is listed, and the team_season references team_id, I should use team.\n\nSo the query would be:\n\nSELECT t.team_name\nFROM team_season ts\nJOIN season s ON ts.season_id = s.id\nJOIN team t ON ts.team_id = t.id\nWHERE s.start_year = 2022\nORDER BY ts.pct_game_win DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n\nBut wait, the user's example uses aliases like p for player. So maybe I should use aliases here for clarity. Let me adjust:\n\nSELECT tm.team_name\nFROM team_season ts\nJOIN season s ON ts.season_id = s.id\nJOIN team tm ON ts.team_id = tm.id\nWHERE s.start_year = 2022\nORDER BY ts.pct_game_win DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n\nYes, that's better. So the team table is aliased as tm. The team_season as ts. The season as s.\n\nNow, checking the columns: team_season has pct_game_win, which is a DOUBLE. So ordering by that should work. The team_name is in the team table. The season's start_year is a BIGINT, so comparing to 2022 is correct.\n\nI think that's the correct query. Let me make sure there's no other tables needed. The game_summary has winning_team_id, but that's per game. But the team_season already aggregates the winning percentage for the season. So using team_season is more efficient.\n\nSo the final SQL query is as above.\n\u25c1/think\u25b7\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT tm.team_name\nFROM team_season ts\nJOIN season s ON ts.season_id = s.id\nJOIN team tm ON ts.team_id = tm.id\nWHERE s.start_year = 2022\nORDER BY ts.pct_game_win DESC\nLIMIT 5\n```\n</sql_query>",

                "llm_response": "\u25c1think\u25b7Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know how many games Kevin Love scored at least 20 points during his rookie season. The answer should be a SQL query that returns the column nb_games.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which tables to use. The question involves a player's performance in games, specifically points scored. The game_boxscore table has points per game for each player. The player_season table has aggregate stats per season, including nb_games. But since we need games where he scored at least 20, maybe we need to count from game_boxscore.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"rookie season\". So I need to find out which season was Kevin Love's rookie year. The season table has start and end years. But maybe the player_season table has the season_id for each player's seasons. However, determining the rookie season might require knowing when the player was drafted or first played. Alternatively, maybe the earliest season_id in player_season for Kevin Love is the rookie season.\n\nBut how do I get Kevin Love's player_id? The player table has player_name and id. So first, I need to join the player table to get the id where player_name is 'Kevin Love'.\n\nThen, for the games where he scored >=20 points, I need to look in game_boxscore. The points column is there. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Find Kevin Love's player_id from the player table.\n2. Join game_boxscore where player_id matches and points >=20.\n3. Join game_summary to get the season_id (from game_summary's season_id) for each game.\n4. Determine which season is the rookie season. Maybe the earliest season_id in player_season for Kevin Love.\n\nWait, but how to link the game's season? The game_summary has season_id. So each game is associated with a season. So for each game where Kevin Love scored >=20, we can get the season_id from game_summary. Then, check if that season is his rookie season.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rookie season is the first season in which the player appeared in the player_season table. So for Kevin Love's player_id, find the earliest season_id in player_season. Then, count the number of games in game_boxscore where the season_id of the game matches that rookie season and points >=20.\n\nWait, but how to link the game's season_id to the player's season? Maybe the player_season table has season_id and player_id. So for Kevin Love's rookie season, find the season_id in player_season where player_id is his and perhaps nb_games is not zero. Then, in game_boxscore, for games where the game's season_id (from game_summary) matches that rookie season, and the player is Kevin Love, and points >=20, count the number of such games.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Get Kevin Love's player_id from player table.\n2. Find the earliest season_id in player_season for that player_id (assuming rookie is first season).\n3. Join game_boxscore with game_summary to get the season_id for each game.\n4. Filter games where player_id is Kevin Love's, season_id is the rookie season, and points >=20.\n5. Count the number of such games.\n\nBut how to get the season_id for each game? The game_summary has season_id. So in game_boxscore, the game_id can be joined with game_summary's id to get the season_id.\n\nSo the joins would be:\n\nplayer p\ninner join game_boxscore gb on gb.player_id = p.id\ninner join game_summary gs on gs.id = gb.game_id\n\nThen, filter where p.player_name = 'Kevin Love' and gb.points >=20 and gs.season_id = (the rookie season_id).\n\nBut how to get the rookie season_id? Maybe subquery: select the min(season_id) from player_season where player_id = p.id.\n\nWait, but in the same query, perhaps:\n\nFirst, find the rookie season for Kevin Love. That would be the earliest season_id in player_season where player_id is his. So:\n\nSELECT season_id FROM player_season WHERE player_id = (SELECT id FROM player WHERE player_name = 'Kevin Love') ORDER BY season_id LIMIT 1.\n\nThen, in the main query, join game_boxscore with game_summary, filter where player is Kevin Love, season_id is the rookie season, and points >=20. Then count the number of games.\n\nBut how to structure this in SQL. Maybe using a CTE or a subquery.\n\nAlternatively, first get the rookie season_id, then use that in the WHERE clause.\n\nSo the SQL query would be something like:\n\nWITH rookie_season AS (\n    SELECT ps.season_id\n    FROM player p\n    JOIN player_season ps ON ps.player_id = p.id\n    WHERE p.player_name = 'Kevin Love'\n    ORDER BY ps.season_id\n    LIMIT 1\n)\nSELECT COUNT(*) as nb_games\nFROM player p\nJOIN game_boxscore gb ON gb.player_id = p.id\nJOIN game_summary gs ON gs.id = gb.game_id\nJOIN rookie_season rs ON gs.season_id = rs.season_id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'Kevin Love' AND gb.points >= 20;\n\nBut maybe there's a more efficient way. Also, the user wants the column named nb_games. So the SELECT should be COUNT(*) as nb_games.\n\nBut perhaps the player_season table already has the total number of games where he scored >=20? Probably not, since player_season has aggregates like total_points, but not specific counts for >=20 points games.\n\nSo the correct approach is to count the games in game_boxscore where the conditions are met.\n\nSo the steps in the query:\n\n1. Join player, game_boxscore, game_summary to get the player's games and their season.\n2. Filter for Kevin Love.\n3. Filter for points >=20.\n4. Filter for the rookie season (which is the earliest season_id for the player).\n5. Count the number of games.\n\nBut how to get the earliest season_id. Maybe in a subquery:\n\nSELECT season_id FROM player_season WHERE player_id = (SELECT id FROM player WHERE player_name = 'Kevin Love') ORDER BY season_id LIMIT 1;\n\nBut in the main query, perhaps:\n\nSELECT COUNT(*) as nb_games\nFROM player p\nJOIN game_boxscore gb ON gb.player_id = p.id\nJOIN game_summary gs ON gs.game_id = gb.game_id  -- Wait, wait. Wait, the game_summary's id is the game_id. Wait, looking at the tables:\n\nIn game_boxscore, the game_id is a VARCHAR, which matches game_summary's id. So the join is on gb.game_id = gs.id.\n\nThen, the season_id is from gs.\n\nSo the query would be:\n\nSELECT COUNT(*) as nb_games\nFROM player p\nJOIN game_boxscore gb ON gb.player_id = p.id\nJOIN game_summary gs ON gs.id = gb.game_id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'Kevin Love'\nAND gb.points >= 20\nAND gs.season_id = (SELECT MIN(ps.season_id) FROM player_season ps WHERE ps.player_id = p.id);\n\nBut wait, the subquery is correlated. Because for each row in the main query, the subquery would select the min season_id for the current p.id. But since we are filtering p.player_name = 'Kevin Love', the p.id is fixed. So the subquery would return the earliest season_id for Kevin Love.\n\nSo the query would be:\n\nSELECT COUNT(*) as nb_games\nFROM player p\nJOIN game_boxscore gb ON gb.player_id = p.id\nJOIN game_summary gs ON gs.id = gb.game_id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'Kevin Love'\nAND gb.points >= 20\nAND gs.season_id = (SELECT MIN(ps.season_id) FROM player_season ps WHERE ps.player_id = p.id);\n\nBut wait, the player_season table has player_id and season_id. So for Kevin Love's player_id, find the minimum season_id. Then, in the main query, join the game_summary's season_id to that.\n\nBut maybe the game_summary's season_id is the same as the player_season's season_id. So this should work.\n\nBut let me check the tables again. The game_summary has season_id. The player_season has season_id. So the game's season_id is the same as the player's season for that game. So yes.\n\nSo the query should count the number of games where Kevin Love scored >=20 points during his rookie season (the earliest season_id in player_season for him).\n\nBut what if the player_season table doesn't have entries for all seasons? But assuming that the player_season has entries for all seasons the player played in, then the min(season_id) would be the rookie season.\n\nSo the SQL query would be as above.\n\nBut let me structure it properly. The user wants the column named nb_games. So the SELECT is COUNT(*) as nb_games.\n\nBut maybe there's a mistake in the join. Let me check the table schemas again.\n\ngame_boxscore has game_id, which is a VARCHAR. game_summary has id as VARCHAR. So joining on gb.game_id = gs.id is correct.\n\nSo the query should be:\n\nSELECT COUNT(*) as nb_games\nFROM player p\nJOIN game_boxscore gb ON gb.player_id = p.id\nJOIN game_summary gs ON gs.id = gb.game_id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'Kevin Love'\nAND gb.points >= 20\nAND gs.season_id = (SELECT MIN(ps.season_id) FROM player_season ps WHERE ps.player_id = p.id);\n\nBut wait, the subquery is part of the WHERE clause. So for each row in the main query, it checks if the game's season_id is equal to the min season_id for the player. But since the player is fixed (Kevin Love), the subquery will return the same value for all rows. So it's okay.\n\nBut maybe the subquery could be optimized by using a CTE or a scalar subquery. But in terms of correctness, this should work.\n\nSo the final SQL query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) as nb_games\nFROM player p\nJOIN game_boxscore gb ON gb.player_id = p.id\nJOIN game_summary gs ON gs.id = gb.game_id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'Kevin Love'\nAND gb.points >= 20\nAND gs.season_id = (SELECT MIN(ps.season_id) FROM player_season ps WHERE ps.player_id = p.id);\n```\n\nBut wait, the user's example shows that the output is in a sql_query tag with the code. So the answer should be formatted as:\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nselect count(*) as nb_games\nfrom player p\ninner join game_boxscore gb on gb.player_id = p.id\ninner join game_summary gs on gs.id = gb.game_id\nwhere p.player_name = 'Kevin Love'\nand gb.points >= 20\nand gs.season_id = (select min(ps.season_id) from player_season ps where ps.player_id = p.id)\n```\n</sql_query>\n\nBut let me check the syntax. The subquery in the WHERE clause is correct. The aliases are properly used. The joins are correct. The condition is checking for the rookie season.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the player's rookie season is determined by the first season they played in, which is captured in the player_season table. So the min(season_id) from player_season for the player is the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, the SQL query should be as above.\n\u25c1/think\u25b7\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nselect count(*) as nb_games\nfrom player p\ninner join game_boxscore gb on gb.player_id = p.id\ninner join game_summary gs on gs.id = gb.game_id\nwhere p.player_name = 'Kevin Love'\nand gb.points >= 20\nand gs.season_id = (select min(ps.season_id) from player_season ps where ps.player_id = p.id)\n```\n</sql_query>",

The answer should only include the column max_points.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which tables to use. The game_boxscore table has a points column, which likely records the points a player scored in a specific game. The player table has the player's name and ID. The season table might have information about when each season started and ended. But since the user mentioned \"first season,\" maybe we need to find when Lillard's first season was.\n\nWait, the player_season table might track a player's stats for each season. So maybe we can find Lillard's first season there. But the main goal is to get the max points in a single game, so the game_boxscore is crucial.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Find Damian Lillard's player ID from the player table.\n2. Determine his first season. Maybe using the player_season table, find the earliest season_id where he played.\n3. Then, in the game_boxscore, filter for games where the player_id is Lillard's and the game's season matches his first season.\n4. From those games, find the maximum points.\n\nBut how to link the game_boxscore to the season? The game_summary has a season_id. So game_boxscore's game_id can be joined with game_summary's id to get the season_id.\n\nSo the query would involve:\n\n- Joining player to game_boxscore on player_id.\n- Joining game_boxscore to game_summary on game_id to get the season.\n- Filter where player_name is 'Damian Lillard' and season_id is his first season.\n- Then group by game and find the max points.\n\nWait, but the user wants the maximum points in a single game. So we need to look at each game Lillard played in his first season and find the highest points.\n\nSo the SQL would be something like:\n\nSELECT MAX(points) as max_points\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'Damian Lillard'\nAND gs.season_id = (SELECT season_id FROM player_season WHERE player_id = p.id ORDER BY season_id LIMIT 1);\n\nWait, but how to determine the first season? The player_season table has season_id for each player. So for Lillard's player_id, find the earliest season_id. Then join that with game_summary's season_id.\n\nBut maybe the season table has start and end dates. Alternatively, the first season could be the earliest season_id in the player_season table for Lillard.\n\nSo the subquery would be: find the earliest season_id for Damian Lillard in player_season.\n\nThen, in the main query, join game_boxscore with game_summary to get the season_id, and filter where the season_id matches the first one.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nSELECT MAX(gb.points) as max_points\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'Damian Lillard'\nAND gs.season_id = (\n    SELECT season_id\n    FROM player_season ps\n    WHERE ps.player_id = p.id\n    ORDER BY season_id\n    LIMIT 1\n);\n\nBut wait, the player_season table's season_id is a foreign key to the season table. The season_id might be in the format like '2012-2013' or similar. But the key is to find the earliest season_id for Lillard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the season table has start_year. But perhaps the player_season's season_id is ordered, so the first one is the earliest.\n\nSo the subquery gets the first season_id for Lillard, then the main query filters the games in that season and finds the max points.\n\nThat should work. Now, check the column names. The game_boxscore has a 'points' column. The player table has 'player_name' and 'id'. The game_summary has 'season_id'.\n\nSo the SQL query would be:\n\nSELECT MAX(gb.points) as max_points\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'Damian Lillard'\nAND gs.season_id = (\n    SELECT season_id\n    FROM player_season ps\n    WHERE ps.player_id = p.id\n    ORDER BY season_id\n    LIMIT 1\n);\n\nBut wait, the player_season table's season_id is the same as in game_summary? Yes, because player_season tracks a player's stats per season, and game_summary's season_id is the season the game belongs to.\n\nSo this query should correctly find the first season of Lillard and then find the max points in any game during that season.\n\nNow, the user asked for only the column max_points. So the SELECT clause is correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider: What if there are multiple games with the same max points?

                "llm_response": "\u25c1think\u25b7Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know how many triple doubles James Harden achieved during the 2022 calendar season. The answer should return only the num_triple_double column.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a triple double is. In basketball, a triple double occurs when a player accumulates a double-digit number in three of five statistical categories: points, rebounds, assists, steals, or blocks. So, for each game, I need to check if a player has at least 10 in three of these categories.\n\nLooking at the available tables, the game_boxscore seems relevant because it contains per-game statistics for each player. The columns like points, total_rebounds (which is the sum of offensive and defensive rebounds), assists, steals, and blocks are present. So, for each row in game_boxscore, I can check if the player has at least three of these stats at 10 or more.\n\nBut wait, the user specified the 2022 calendar season. The game_summary table has a date column, which I can use to filter games that occurred in 2022. So I need to join game_boxscore with game_summary on game_id to get the date of each game.\n\nAdditionally, I need to identify James Harden's player_id. The player table has player_name and id. So I should join game_boxscore with player to get the player's name.\n\nPutting this together, the steps would be:\n\n1. Join game_boxscore with game_summary to get the date of each game.\n2. Join game_boxscore with player to get the player's name.\n3. Filter for games where the date is in 2022.\n4. Filter for the player named James Harden.\n5. For each game, check if the player has at least three of the five stats (points, total_rebounds, assists, steals, blocks) >= 10.\n6. Count the number of such games.\n\nWait, but how do I check for three out of five stats being >=10? That's a bit tricky. Maybe using a CASE statement to count how many of the five stats meet the condition. For example:\n\nCASE WHEN points >= 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END +\nCASE WHEN total_rebounds >= 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END +\nCASE WHEN assists >= 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END +\nCASE WHEN steals >= 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END +\nCASE WHEN blocks >= 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END >= 3\n\nIf the sum is >=3, then it's a triple double.\n\nSo, in the WHERE clause, after filtering for 2022 and James Harden, I need to add a condition that this sum is >=3.\n\nBut wait, the user wants the count of such games. So after filtering, I can group by the player and count the number of games where this condition is met.\n\nWait, but maybe the triple double count is already stored somewhere. Looking at the tables, the player_season table has various totals and averages, but I don't see a specific triple double count. So I have to calculate it from the game_boxscore data.\n\nSo the SQL query would involve:\n\nSELECT COUNT(*) as num_triple_double\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'James Harden'\nAND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) = 2022\nAND (\n    (points >= 10) + (total_rebounds >= 10) + (assists >= 10) + (steals >= 10) + (blocks >= 10)\n) >= 3;\n\nWait, but in SQL, the way to add boolean conditions is using CASE statements. Because in PostgreSQL, boolean true is 1 and false is 0 when cast to integer. So perhaps:\n\nSELECT COUNT(*) as num_triple_double\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'James Harden'\nAND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) = 2022\nAND (\n    (CASE WHEN points >= 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) +\n    (CASE WHEN total_rebounds >= 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) +\n    (CASE WHEN assists >= 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) +\n    (CASE WHEN steals >= 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) +\n    (CASE WHEN blocks >= 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)\n) >= 3;\n\nBut that's a bit verbose. Alternatively, using a combination of CASE and COALESCE:\n\nSELECT COUNT(*) as num_triple_double\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'James Harden'\nAND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) = 2022\nAND (\n    (points >= 10)::int + (total_rebounds >= 10)::int + (assists >= 10)::int + (steals >= 10)::int + (blocks >= 10)::int\n) >= 3;\n\nBut I need to make sure that the columns exist. Looking back at the game_boxscore table, the columns are:\n\npoints: INTEGER\ntotal_rebounds: INTEGER (sum of offensive and defensive)\nassists: INTEGER\nsteals: INTEGER\nblocks: INTEGER\n\nYes, those are present. So the query would join these tables, filter by player name and year, then check the sum of the boolean conditions.\n\nBut wait, the user's example shows that the output should be a single column named num_triple_double. So the SELECT statement should be:\n\nSELECT COUNT(*) as num_triple_double\n...\n\nBut also, the user's example uses a LIMIT 1, but in this case, since we're counting, it's not necessary.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the player's name might have variations. But the user provided \"James Harden\", so assuming that's the exact name in the player table.\n\nAlso, the date in game_summary is a DATE type. Using EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) = 2022 would filter for dates in the year 2022. However, the NBA season might span two calendar years (e.g., 2021-2022 season). But the user specifically asked for the 2022 calendar season, so the filter is correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the SQL query would be:\n\nSELECT COUNT(*) as num_triple_double\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'James Harden'\nAND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) = 2022\nAND (\n    (points >= 10)::int + \n    (total_rebounds >= 10)::int + \n    (assists >= 10)::int + \n    (steals >= 10)::int + \n    (blocks >= 10)::int\n) >= 3;\n\nBut in PostgreSQL, casting boolean to int can be done with ::int. Alternatively, using CASE statements. But the above should work.\n\nWait, but in PostgreSQL, the correct way to cast is using ::integer. But maybe ::int is acceptable. Alternatively, using the CASE approach.\n\nAlternatively, using a GREATEST function, but that's more complicated.\n\nAnother approach: for each game, calculate the number of stats that are >=10, then check if that number is >=3.\n\nSo, the query would be:\n\nSELECT COUNT(*) as num_triple_double\nFROM (\n    SELECT gb.game_id, \n           ( (points >= 10)::int + \n             (total_rebounds >= 10)::int + \n             (assists >= 10)::int + \n             (steals >= 10)::int + \n             (blocks >= 10)::int ) as triple_double_count\n    FROM game_boxscore gb\n    JOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\n    JOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\n    WHERE p.player_name = 'James Harden'\n    AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) = 2022\n) subquery\nWHERE triple_double_count >= 3;\n\nBut this might be more efficient. However, the original query without the subquery should also work.\n\nBut the user's example shows that the output is a single row with the column. So the query should return a single row with the count.\n\nSo the final SQL query would be:\n\nSELECT COUNT(*) as num_triple_double\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'James Harden'\nAND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) = 2022\nAND (\n    (points >= 10)::integer + \n    (total_rebounds >= 10)::integer + \n    (assists >= 10)::integer + \n    (steals >= 10)::integer + \n    (blocks >= 10)::integer\n) >= 3;\n\nBut wait, the columns in game_boxscore are:\n\npoints: INTEGER\ntotal_rebounds: INTEGER (offensive_rebounds + defensive_rebounds)\nassists: INTEGER\nsteals: INTEGER\nblocks: INTEGER\n\nYes. So the conditions are correct.\n\nAnother thing: the user's example uses a LIMIT 1, but in this case, since we're using COUNT(*), it's not necessary. The COUNT will return a single row.\n\nSo the query should work. Now, let's structure the response as per the instructions.\n\nThe thinking part would be:\n\nTo find the number of triple doubles James Harden had in 2022, I need to:\n\n1. Join game_boxscore with game_summary to get the game dates.\n2. Join game_boxscore with player to get the player's name.\n3. Filter for games in 2022.\n4. Filter for James Harden.\n5. For each game, check if at least three of the five stats (points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks) are >=10.\n6. Count the number of such games.\n\nThe SQL query would involve these steps, using JOINs, WHERE clauses, and a condition to check the triple double criteria.\n\nNow, the SQL query in the required format:\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) as num_triple_double\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'James Harden'\nAND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) = 2022\nAND (\n    (points >= 10)::integer + \n    (total_rebounds >= 10)::integer + \n    (assists >= 10)::integer + \n    (steals >= 10)::integer + \n    (blocks >= 10)::integer\n) >= 3;\n```\n</sql_query>\n\nBut wait, the user's example shows that the output should have only the column num_triple_double. The query above selects COUNT(*) as num_triple_double, which should be correct.\n\nAnother possible issue: the player's name might have a different case. For example, if the database stores it as 'james harden' or 'James Harden'. The query uses exact case. But assuming the database has the correct capitalization, this should be okay. Alternatively, using UPPER(p.player_name) = 'JAMES HARDEN' to handle case insensitivity. But the user's example uses exact case, so maybe it's safe to assume the data is stored correctly.\n\nSo the final answer is as above.\n\u25c1/think\u25b7\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) as num_triple_double\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN game_summary gs ON gb.game_id = gs.id\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nWHERE p.player_name = 'James Harden'\nAND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM gs.date) = 2022\nAND (\n    (points >= 10)::integer + \n    (total_rebounds >= 10)::integer + \n    (assists >= 10)::integer + \n    (steals >= 10)::integer + \n    (blocks >= 10)::integer\n) >= 3;\n```\n</sql_query>",

I need to return the name of the team that achieved this\n\nLooking at the available tables:\n- `game_summary` contains game details including `home_team_id`, `home_team_points`, and `away_team_points`\n- `team` contains team information with `id` and `team_name`\n\nThe approach is:\n1. Join `game_summary` with `team` on `home_team_id` to get team names\n2. Order the results by `home_team_points` in descending order\n3. Limit the results to 1 to get the highest-scoring home game\n4. Return only the team name\n\nThis will give me the team that scored the most points in a single home game.\n</thinking>\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT t.team_name\nFROM game_summary gs\nJOIN team t ON gs.home_team_id = t.id\nORDER BY gs.home_team_points DESC\nLIMIT 1\n```\n</sql_query>",
