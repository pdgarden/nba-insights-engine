The goal is to find the maximum winning percentage across all teams in any season.\n2. The relevant table for team win percentages per season is `team_season`, which contains:\n   - `pct_game_win`: the winning percentage (as a decimal, e.g., 0.75 for 75%).\n3. We need to extract the maximum value of `pct_game_win` from this table.\n4. The question asks for the result in percentage, scaled between 0 and 100. So we must multiply `pct_game_win` by 100.\n5. The precision requirement is 0.2%, meaning we should round to one decimal place (e.g., 78.4%).\n6. We need to return the result as a column named `max_pct_game_win`.\n\nNo joins are needed because `team_season` already contains the winning percentage per team per season.\n\nThus, the query is straightforward: select the maximum of `pct_game_win * 100`, rounded to one decimal place (to achieve 0.2% precision), and alias it as `max_pct_game_win`.\n</thinking>\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT ROUND(MAX(pct_game_win * 100), 1) AS max_pct_game_win\nFROM team_season;\n```</sql_query>",

Return only the number, named avg_diff.\"\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The question asks for the **average number of games scored** by home teams vs away teams. However, \"games scored\" is ambiguous \u2014 in basketball, we usually refer to points scored per game.\n\n2. Looking at the schema:\n   - `game_summary` contains `home_team_points` and `away_team_points`, which are the total points scored by each team in a game.\n   - We need to compute the **average points per game** for home teams and away teams separately.\n\n3. The `game_summary` table has:\n   - `home_team_points`: points scored by the home team\n   - `away_team_points`: points scored by the away team\n   - Each row represents one game.\n\n4. So, to compute:\n   - Average home team points: AVG(home_team_points)\n   - Average away team points: AVG(away_team_points)\n\n5. Then compute the difference: AVG(home_team_points) - AVG(away_team_points)\n\n6. Round the result to 1 decimal place (0.1 precision).\n\n7. Return only the number, named `avg_diff`.\n\nNo joins are needed \u2014 all required data is in `game_summary`.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT ROUND(AVG(home_team_points) - AVG(away_team_points), 1) AS avg_diff\nFROM game_summary;\n```</sql_query>",

The key metric we are interested in is the maximum number of blocks (`blocks`) recorded in a single game.\n2. The `game_boxscore` table contains the `blocks` column for each player per game, along with `player_id` and `game_id`.\n3. The `player` table contains the `player_name` linked by `id = player_id`.\n4. We need to find the maximum value of `blocks` across all games.\n5. Since multiple players might have achieved the same highest number of blocks in different games, we must return all such players.\n6. We will join `game_boxscore` with `player` on `player_id = id`.\n7. We will filter for the maximum `blocks` value (using a subquery or window function).\n8. Then select `player_name` and the `blocks` value (as max_nb_blocks).\n9. Sort the results by `player_name`.\n\nApproach:\n- Use a subquery to find the maximum number of blocks in any single game.\n- Join `game_boxscore` with `player` to get player names.\n- Filter rows where `blocks` equals that maximum.\n- Select `player_name` and `blocks` (aliased as `max_nb_blocks`).\n- Order by `player_name`.\n\nNote: The `blocks` column in `game_boxscore` is of type INTEGER, so we can directly compare it.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT p.player_name, gb.blocks AS max_nb_blocks\nFROM game_boxscore gb\nJOIN player p ON gb.player_id = p.id\nWHERE gb.blocks = (SELECT MAX(blocks) FROM game_boxscore)\nORDER BY p.player_name;\n```\n</sql_query>",

We need to get his `id`.\n\n2. The number of games played per season by a player is stored in the `player_season` table under `nb_games`, which corresponds to each season.\n\n3. We need to filter for seasons between 2005 and 2015 inclusive. The `season` table has a `start_year` and `end_year` column. Since the seasons are labeled by their start year (e.g., 2005\u20132006 season has start_year = 2005), we can filter where `start_year` is between 2005 and 2015.\n\n4. We need to join:\n   - `player` with `player_season` on `player.id = player_season.player_id`\n   - `player_season` with `season` on `player_season.season_id = season.id`\n\n5.

Identify relevant tables:\n   - `game_boxscore`: contains `three_pts_attempts` and `game_id`.\n   - `game_summary`: contains `game_id` and `season_id`.\n   - `season`: contains `id`, `start_year`, and `years`.\n\n2.

Return only the column team_name\"\n\nStep-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Identify the relevant tables:\n   - `team_season`: contains team performance per season, including number of games won (`nb_game_win`) and total games played (`nb_game`), which can be used to compute winning percentage.\n   - `season`: contains information about the season, including `start_year` and `end_year`. We need the season starting in 2022, so we look for `start_year = 2022`.\n   - `team_bis` or `team`: contains the `team_name`. Since both tables have `team_name`, but `team_bis` is likely a duplicate or alternative, I'll use `team` as it's more standard.\n\n2. Join logic:\n   - Join `team_season` with `season` on `season_id = id` to filter by season starting in 2022.\n   - Join `team_season` with `team` on `team_id = id` to get the team name.\n\n3. Filter:\n   - Only include rows where `start_year = 2022`.\n\n4. Compute winning percentage:\n   - Winning percentage = `nb_game_win / nb_game`\n   - Since `nb_game_win` and `nb_game` are integers, we need to cast them to float to avoid integer division.\n\n5. Order by winning percentage descending.\n\n6. Limit to top 5 teams.\n\n7. Select only the `team_name`.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<sql_query>\n```sql\nSELECT t.team_name\nFROM team_season ts\nJOIN season s ON ts.season_id = s.id\nJOIN team t ON ts.team_id = t.id\nWHERE s.start_year = 2022\nORDER BY (ts.nb_game_win::DOUBLE PRECISION / ts.nb_game) DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n```</sql_query>",
